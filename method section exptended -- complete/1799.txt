2.3.3. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis of the reaction
products
The samples were dissolved in tetrahydrofuran to the approximate
concentration of 10 mg/mL and analyzed using HP (Agilent)
system 1050 HPLC equipped with a Waters Styragel HR4 E
8  300 mm column and an HP (Agilent) 1050 Autosampler. The
detectors used were HP (Agilent) 1050 Diode Array UV Detector
(250 nm) and HP Refractive Index analog detector. The UV detector
was connected before the RI detector, which induced a slight shift
(ca 30 s) in the elution times. Samples (injection volume 25 lL)
were analyzed at ambient temperature. Tetrahydrofuran (inhibitor-
free) was used as the mobile phase (0.5 mL/min). Polystyrenes
were used as standards with molar masses of 114, 45, 12, 3.7 and
0.68 kDa.
