3. Material and methods
3.1. Material
The soft and mature okra pods, A. esculentus (L.) Moench (5–
10 cm in length), were grown and collected at the local market in
June 2005, Thailand.
3.2. Isolation of alcohol-insoluble solid
After removal of the seeds, the okra pods were sliced and
homogenised two times with 70% (v/v) aqueous ethanol at room
temperature. After filtration, the insoluble residues were combined
and washed with two volumes of chloroform/methanol (1/1, v/v)
with gentle stirring for 30 min to remove low molecular weight
(coloured) compounds.45 After filtration, the filtrates were washed
with acetone and air dried (alcohol-insoluble solids, AIS).
3.3. Sequential extraction of okra AIS
Okra AIS (20 g) were sequentially extracted according to Vierhuis
et al.24 with 600 mLof the following extractants; 0.05 Msodium acetate
buffer at pH 5.2 and 70 C (hot buffer soluble solids, HBSS),
0.05 M EDTA and 0.05 M sodium acetate in 0.05 M sodium oxalate
atpH5.2 and 70  C (chelating agent soluble solids, CHSS), 0.05 Msodium
hydroxide at 0 C and 20 mMNaBH4 (diluted alkali soluble solids,
DASS), and 6 M sodium hydroxide at 0 C and 20 mM NaBH4
(concentrated alkali soluble solids, CASS). The extraction was continually
performed until the total sugar content of the last supernatant
was lower than 40 lg/mL, which was determined by phenol–
sulfuric acid assay.46 After each extraction, solubilised polymer
was separated from the insoluble residue by centrifugation
(19,000g for 25 min). The supernatants were ultra filtrated through
a 30 kDa membrane (A/G Technology Corporation) and freeze-dried.
The final residues were dialysed and freeze-dried.
3.4. Analytical methods
3.4.1. Total neutral sugar and uronic acid content
The total neutral sugar content and uronic acid content were
determined colorimetrically by automated orcinol/sulfuric acid assay47
and m-hydroxydiphenyl assay,48–50 respectively, using an
auto-analyser (Skalar Analytical BV, Breda, The Netherlands). Galactose
and galacturonic acid were used as a standard. Corrections
were made for the interference of uronic acid in the samples. Distinction
between galacturonic acid and glucuronic acid was made
by high performance anion-exchange chromatography (HPAEC,
Dionex, USA) after methanolysis according to De Ruiter et al.51
3.4.2. Sugar composition
The neutral sugar composition of okra AIS was determined by
gas chromatography52 using inositol as internal standard. The samples
were submitted to a prehydrolysis treatment with 72% w/w
sulfuric acid at 30 C for 1 h followed by a hydrolyses step using
1 M sulfuric acid at 100 C for 3 h. The sugars were converted to
their alditol acetates and analysed by GC according to Hilz et al.25
For the obtained fractions, after drying at 40 C under vacuum
over P2O5, the samples were hydrolysed with 2 M HCl in dry methanol
at 80 C for 16 h and followed by 2 MTFA at 121 C for 1 h. The
monomers were analysed by using high performance anion-exchange
chromatography (HPAEC, Dionex, USA) equipped with the
(2  250 mm) CarboPac PA 1 column (Dionex, USA) and post column
(Dionex, USA) addition. Millipore water, 0.1 M NaOH and
1 M NaOAc in 0.1 M NaOH with a flow of 0.3 mL/min at 20 C were
used as eluent, and 0.5 M NaOH with a flow of 0.1 mL/min at 20 C
was added to post column for allowance of the PAD detection.
The following gradient was applied using a flow of 0.3 mL/min
at 20 C of NaOH: 0–30.0 min, 0 mM; 30.0–30.1 min, 0–100 mM;
30.1–50.0 min, 100 mM. The simultaneous gradient of NaOAc
was 0.0–30.1 min, 0 mM; 30.1–45.0 min min, 0–400 mM; 45.1–
50.0, 1000 mM. Millipore water was used from 0.0 to 30.0 min.
For the post column, 0.5 M NaOH with a flow of 0.1 mL/min was
used during 0.0–30.1 min. After each run the column was washed
for 5 min with 1 M NaOAc in 0.1 M NaOH, for 8 min with 0.1 M
NaOH and subsequently equilibrated with water for 15 min.53
3.4.3. Absolute configuration
The configuration of all sugars present was analysed by gas
chromatography, and methyl-a-D-galactopyranoside was used as internal standard. The sample was methanolysed with 1 M HCl in
dry methanol. After conversion to their corresponding ()-2-butyl
glycosides and trimethylsilation, the trimethylsilated ()-2-butyl
glycosides were analysed by GC-FID.54
3.4.4. Degree of acetylation and methyl esterification
The degree of acetylation and methyl esterification of samples
were determined after saponification with 0.4 M sodium hydroxide
in isopropanol/water (50/50 v/v) by using Thermo Finnigan
(USA) high performance liquid chromatography equipped with
Aminex HPX 87H column (Bio-Rad, USA).55 The elution took place
at 40 C with 0.01 N H2SO4 at a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min. The degree
of acetylation and methyl esterification were calculated as moles of
acetic acids and methanol per 100 moles of galacturonic acid,
respectively.
3.4.5. Protein content
Protein content was determined by the combustion method56
with a Thermo Quest NA 2100 Nitrogen and Protein Analyser
(Interscience, The Netherlands). D-Methionine was used as external
standard. The protein content was calculated using 6.25 as nitrogen
to protein conversion factor.
3.4.6. High performance size exclusion chromatography
(HPSEC)
High performance size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) was
performed on a Thermo Separation Products (USA) HPLC, equipped
with three TosoH Biosep-TSK-Gel G columns (Methyacrylate resin)
in series (7.8 mm  30 cm, 4000PWXL–3000PWXL–2500PWXL) in
combination with a PWXL-guard column (TosoH, Japan). Samples
(5 mg/mL; except for HBSS: 1 mg/mL) were eluted at 30 C with
0.2 M sodium nitrate at a flow rate of 0.8 mL/min.57 The column
effluent was monitored using a reflective index detector (Shodex
SE-61, Showa Denko K.K., Japan). Calibration was done using pectins
having known molecular weight.20
3.4.7. Glycosidic linkage analysis
The glycosidic linkage composition of each sample was analysed
as described by Hakomori58 and modified by Verhoef
et al.59 The partially methylated alditol acetates were analysed
by GC-FID and GC–MS according to Verhoef et al.59
3.4.8. Enzymatic degradation
3.4.8.1. Pectin degradation. The HBSS fraction was dissolved
(3 mg/ml) in 50 mM NaOAc buffer, at pH 5, and incubated
with 0.016 units of polygalacturonase from A. aculeatus and
1.08 units of pectin methyl esterase from A. niger.20 The CHSS
fraction (4 mg/mL) was incubated with 0.024 units of polygalacturonase.
The incubations were performed at 40 C for 24 h, and
the digests were subsequently heated for 5 min at 100 C to
inactivate the enzyme. The digests were dialysed by Centricon
centrifugal filter devises with 3 kDa cut off at 1500g for 30 min
and then, freeze-dried.
3.4.8.2. Xyloglucan-specific endo-glucanase (XEG) degradation.
The CASS fraction was dissolved (5 mg/mL) in 50 mM
NaOAc buffer, at pH 5, and incubated with 2.3 units of xyloglucan-
specific endo-glucanase from A. aculeatus38 at 40 C for
16 h. The digest was heated at 100 C for 5 min to inactivate
the enzyme.
3.4.8.3. endo-Xylanase III degradation. The CASS fraction
was dissolved (10 mg/mL) in 150 mM NaOAc buffer, at pH 5, and
incubated at 40 C for 24 h with 0.09 units of endo-xylanase III
from A. awamori.36 The enzyme was inactivated by heating the digest
for 5 min at 100 C.
3.4.9. HPAEC of oligosaccharides
For the determination of xyloglucan oligomers, enzyme digests
were analysed by using a 4  250mm CarboPac PA 100 column
(Dionex, USA) with pulsed amperometric detection. Gradients of
NaOH and NaOAc with a flow of 1 mL/min were used to elute the
oligomer according to Vincken et al.37
For the determination of digest from endo-xylanase III, the
(2  250 mm) CarboPac PA 1 column (Dionex, USA) with pulse
amperometric detection was equilibrated with 100 mM NaOH.
Gradients of NaOH and NaOAc were used simultaneously to elute
the oligomers according to Vierhuis et al.36
3.4.10. Matrix–assisted laser desorption ionisation-time of
flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) analysis
MALDI-TOF MS analysis was performed on Ultra flex instrument
(Bruker Daltonics, Germany) with a Nitrogen 337 nm laser
beam. The data were collected from average of 200 shots with
the lowest laser energy (35%). The digest sample was desalted with
resin (AG 50W-X8 Resin, H+ form; Bio-Rad, USA). A small spatula of
Dowex resin was added to 10 lL of sample solution, mixed and
centrifuged for 5 min at 13,000g. One microliter of matrix solution,
10 mg/mL of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid in millipore water (Milli-Q
Gradient A-10, USA) was placed on a MALDI-TOF plate together
with 1 ll of sample solution and dried under a constant warm air.
3.4.11. Anion-exchange chromatography
Anion-exchange chromatography was performed on a DEAE Sepharose
Fast Flow column (50  2.6 cm, Amersham Bioscience,
Sweden) using an akta explorer system (Amersham Biosciences,
Sweden). The sample (280 ml; 0.5 mg/mL) was loaded to the column
(10 mL/min). After loading with sample, the column was
washed with water for 1 column volume (250 mL, 50 mL/min)
and eluted successively with a linear gradient of 0–2 M of NaOAc
buffer, pH 5, within 10 column volumes. Finally the column was
washed with 2 column volumes of 1 M NaOH. During elution with
NaOAc buffer, fractions of 50 mL were collected as well as the column
washed and analysed for neutral sugar and uronic acid content
as described. The alkaline fractions were neutralised directly
by adding acetic acid. After pooling appropriate fractions, pools
were dialysed and freeze-dried. 3.4.12. 13C and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
Prior to NMR analyses, the sample was dissolved in 5 mM
NaOAc, pH 5, to set the pD = pH and freeze-dried. Then the sample
was dissolved in 99.96% D2O (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories,
USA) and after freeze-drying dissolved again in 99.996%
D2O (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, USA). NMR spectra were
recorded at a probe temperature of 25 C on a Bruker AV-600
spectrometer equipped with a cryoprobe located at Biqualys,
Wageningen. Chemical shifts were expressed in ppm relative to
internal acetone: d = 2.225 ppm for 1H. The 1D 1H proton spectra
were recorded at 600.13 MHz using 64 scans of 8192 data points
and a sweep width of 3000 Hz.
