A known amount of
these wet sieved (Van Roon et al. 2003) particles was
incubated overnight at 277 K and pH 8.0 in a solution in
which a known amount of reactant was dissolved. Then the
equilibrium concentration of the reactant in the continuous
phase was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography
(Van Roon et al. 2003) to check for partitioning.
A portion of these particles was transferred into a known
amount of water that was vigorously stirred. Particle-free
samples were taken immediately (by use of filters), and the
concentration was measured with HPLC. From this, the
diffusivity was estimated by fitting a standard parabolic
differential equation for Fickian diffusion (e.g., Bird et al.
1960a,b) out of a known mass of spheres of 205-??m
radius.
