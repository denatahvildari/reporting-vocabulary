 2. Materials and methods
2.1. Material
Black currants (Ribes nigrum L.) were obtained from
Kiantama Ltd., Suomussalmi, Finland. Alcohol insoluble
solids (AIS) were prepared from homogenised berries. In three
extraction steps the pectic polysaccharides were extracted
from AIS. The hemicelluloses were extracted from the
residual cellulose with 6M sodium hydroxide (concentrated
alkali soluble solids; CASS). The solution was directly neutralised
in an ice bath, subsequently dialysed and freeze dried
[17].
2.2. Fractionation of hemicelluloses with anion exchange
chromatography
About 250 mg CASS were dissolved in water and centrifuged.
The pellet was collected (CASS residue) and the
supernatant was fractionated on a DEAE Sepharose Fast
Flow column (100 cm°ø2.6 cm, GE Healthcare, Upsala,
Sweden) into three fractions: unbound material was eluted with
530mL 5mM sodium acetate at pH 5.0 (CASS unbound), the
second fraction was eluted with 530mL 2M sodium acetate
buffer at pH 5.0 (CASS NaOAc), and the last fraction was
eluted with 530mL 0.5M sodium hydroxide (CASS NaOH)
[25].
2.3. Degradation of xyloglucan with xyloglucan specific
endo-glucanase (XEG)
Xyloglucan containing material (5 mg)was dissolved in 1mL
50mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) and incubated with 1 L
xyloglucan specific endo-glucanase (XEG, EC 3.2.1.4 from
Aspergillus aculeatus, 2259 U/mL) over night. AIS (5 mg/mL)
were incubated with additional 5L polygalacturonase (EC
3.2.1.15 from Kluyveromyces fragilis, 16 U/ml) and 1 L pectin
methyl esterase (EC 3.1.1.11 from Aspergillus niger, 180 U/ml)
for pectin degradation [4].
2.4. Sugar composition as alditol acetates
For determining the sugar composition, samples were prehydrolysed
using 72%, w/w sulphuric acid at 30 ◦C for 1 h and
subsequently hydrolyzed with 1M sulphuric acid at 100 ◦C for
3 h [26]. Afterwards the sugars were derivatised to their alditol
acetates and determined by gas chromatography [27] using inositol
as internal standard.
2.5. Uronic acid content
The total uronic acid contentwas determined photometrically
with the automated m-hydroxydiphenyl assay [28].
2.6. HPAEC of xyloglucan oligomers
Xyloglucan oligosaccharides were analysed on a CarboPac
PA 100 column (4mm°ø250 mm, Dionex, Sunnyvale, USA)
and on a CarboPac PA 1 column (2mm°ø250 mm, Dionex,
Sunnyvale, USA) with pulse amperometric detection (PAD)
using a column specific sodium hydoxide-sodium acetategradient
as described before [19] and a flow of 1 mL/min
for the 4mm°ø250mm column and of 0.3 mL/min for the
2mm°ø250mm column, respectively.
Desalted fractions were obtained in two ways:
(a) The ultra-self-regenerating anion suppressor 4 mm-unit
(ASRS, Dionex, Sunnyvale, USA) was connected after the
PAD to exchange the sodium ions for hydronium ions
(H3O+) followed by the ultra-self-regenerating cation suppressor
4 mm-unit (CSRS, Dionex, Sunnyvale, USA) to  exchange the acetate ions for hydroxide ions (OH− ). The
continuous desalting of the eluent was achieved by the electrolysis
of demineralised water (8 ml/min) in both suppressors.
Fractions of 30 s were collected in a 96-well plate using
a FC-203B fraction collector (Gilson, Middleton, USA) and
freeze dried [29] .
(b) Directly after the PAD the FC-203B fraction collector
(Gilson, Middleton, USA) was connected collecting fractions
of 30 s. These fractions were collected in a Sep-Pak
tC18 (40 mg) 96-well plate (Waters, Milford, USA) containing
0.5mL 0.5M acetic acid per well. The eluent was
sucked through the Sep-Pak tC18 (40 mg) 96-well plate by
vacuum with a MultiScreen resist vacuum manifold (Millipore,
Billerica, USA). After washing 2 times with 1mL
water, the oligomers were eluted with 2mL methanol and
dried at 60 ◦ C.
2.7. MALDI–TOF–MS
 Matrix assisted laser desorption ionisation time of flight
mass spectrometry (MALDI–TOF–MS) was performed using
an Ultraflex workstation (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany)
equipped with a nitrogen laser of 337 nm and operated in
positive mode. After a delayed extraction time of 200 ns,
the ions were accelerated to a kinetic energy of 12,000V.
The ions were detected using reflector mode. The lowest
laser power required to obtain good spectra was used and at
least 100 spectra were collected. The mass spectrometer was
calibrated with a mixture of maltodextrins (mass range 300–
2500).
Two microliters sample solution were mixed on the MALDITOF-
plate (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) with 2 L
matrix solution of 9 mg/mL 2,5-dihydroxy-benzoic acid (Bruker
Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) in 30% acetonitrile and dried
under a stream of air [30] .
2.8. Post-source decay
 For post source decay (PSD) the same conditions as for
MALDI–TOF–MS were used. PSD was recorded in the positive
mode. The spectrum was dived into different independently
measured segments, which were put together to one PSD spectrum
by the software FlexAnalysis (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen,
Germany) [30] .
2.9. ESI–MSn
 Electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (ESI–MS) was
performed on a LTQ Ion-trap (Thermo Electron, San Jose,
USA). The sample was applied through a PicoTip emitter capillary
(4 m ID of the tip, New Objective, Woburn, USA). MS
analysis was carried out in the positive mode using a spray voltage
of 1.5 kV and a capillary temperature of 200 ◦ C, auto-tuned
on xyloglucan oligosaccharides.MS2  and higherwas performed
using a window of 1m /z  and a relative collision energy of
30%.
2.10. RP–HPLC–ELSD–ESI–MSn
 Xyloglucan oligomers were separated by reversed phase
HPLC (RP–HPLC) on a XTerra MS C18 3.5 m column
(4.6mm°ø 150 mm, Waters, Milford, USA) with a linear gradient
from 0 to 15% of methanol in 100 min followed by a 10 min
washing step with 100% methanol at a flowof 0.9 mL/min. After
post column splitting 3/4 of the eluent went to a evaporate light
scattering detector ELSD 2000 (Alltech, Lexington, USA) and
1/4 went to a LCQ Deca XP MAX ESI–MSn  detector (Thermo
Electron, San Jose, USA). ESI–MSn  was operated in positive
mode using a spray voltage of 4.0 kV and a capillary temperature
of 200 ◦ C and auto-tuned on xyloglucan oligosaccharides.
MS2  and higher was performed using a window of 1m /z  and a
relative collision energy of 30%.
2.11. CE–LIFD
 For capillary electrophoresis (CE) xyloglucan oligosaccharides
were labelled with 8-aminopyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonate
(APTS) using the ProteomeLab Protein Characterisation kit
(Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, USA).
The labelled oligosaccharides were separated on a polyvinyl
alcohol (N-CHO) coated capillary (50  m ID°ø 50.2 cm, detector
after 40 cm, Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, USA) using a
ProteomeLab PA 800 characterisation system (Beckman Coulter,
Fullerton, USA) and a laser induced fluorescence detector
(LIFD) at an excitation of 488 nm and an emission of 520 nm
(Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, USA). The separation was carried
out in reversed polarity at 30 kV in a 25mM sodium acetate
buffer containing 0.4% polyethylene oxide at pH 4.75. The capillary
was kept at 25 ◦ C. APTS labelled maltose was used as
internal standard.
2.12. CE–ESI–MSn
 For identification of the different oligomers, separation was
carried out on a P/ACE MDQ capillary electrophoresis system
(Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, USA) with a fused silica capillary
(50  m ID°ø 80 cm) connected to a UV-detector and an
ESI–MSn  detector (LTQ Ion-trap, Thermo Electron, San Jose,
USA) by a device made in our laboratory (Fig. 2 ). The separation
was carried out at reversed polarity at 28 kV in a 50mM
ammonium acetate buffer containing 0.2% formic acid at pH 2.8.
The capillary was kept at 15 ◦ C. For ESI–MSn  a sheath flow of
4 L/min of 75% isopropanol in water was used. ESI–MSn  was
operated in the negative mode using a spray voltage of 2.2 kVand
a capillary temperature of 190 ◦ C and auto-tuned on xyloglucan
oligosaccharides. MS2  and higher was performed using a window
of 1m /z  and a relative collision energy of 30%.
