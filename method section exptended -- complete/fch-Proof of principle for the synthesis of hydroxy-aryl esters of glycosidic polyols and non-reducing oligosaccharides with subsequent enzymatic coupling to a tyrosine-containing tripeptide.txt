2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
Ammonia (25% v/v), granular NaBH4, H2O2 (30% v/v), K2CO3,
DMSO (Seccosolv), glacial acetic acid (100%), saccharose, and maltose
(monohydrate) were obtained from Merck (Darmstadt,
Germany). Methyl 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propionate (hydroxyphenyl-
propionate methylester, HPPME), dichloromethane (Chromasolv),
raffinose (pentahydrate), trehalose, maltitol, horseradish
peroxidase Type VI (P-8375, EC 1.11.1.7), catalase (C-3155, EC
1.11.1.6), and D2O (99.9 atom%) were from Sigma Aldrich Corporation
(St. Louis, MO, USA). MeOH was from J.T. Baker (Phillipsburg,
NJ, USA) and the tripeptide H-Gly-Tyr-Gly-OH (GYG, H-3670) from
Bachem (Bubendorf, Switzerland). Met-Arg-Phe-Ala (MRFA) was
bought from Research Plus, Inc. (Barnegat, NJ, USA). Water was
purified by using a Milli-Q Gradient A10 system (Millipore Corporation,
Billerica, MA, USA).
2.2. Methods
2.2.1. Reduction of oligosaccharides and subsequent
purification
Reduction of oligosaccharides was performed using a protocol
based on a previously published method.10 One gram of each oligosaccharide
was dissolved in 20 mL water in a plastic reaction tube,
the pH of this solution was then adjusted to 10.0 using ammonia.
Granular NaBH4 was subsequently added in a molar ratio reducing
ends:NaBH4 = 1:1.33 after which the tubes were capped accurately.
Next, samples were incubated in a shaking incubator
(120 rpm) at 40 C for 90 min. Subsequently, acetic acid was added
till the pH remained below 5.0 and an excess of MeOH was added.
Samples were dried under a stream of dry air and the addition of
MeOH followed by drying was repeated twice.
Solid phase extraction (SPE) was applied for sample purification.
Alltech Carbograph SPE columns (Alltech, Deerfield, IL, USA)
were first activated by rinsing with 3 CV MeOH (CV = Column Volume:
3 mL) and 4 CV water, respectively. Up to 500 mg of reduced
sugar product was dissolved in 1 CV of water and the column was
subsequently loaded with this sample. Salts were eluted with 3 CV
of water, after which reduced sugars were eluted with 3 CV of 10%
(v/v) MeOH in water and 3 CV of 40% (v/v) MeOH in water, respectively.
Fractions were dried using a stream of dry air and stored at
20 C until further analysis or application.
2.2.2. Verification of oligosaccharide reduction products
After reduction and purification, oligosaccharides were analyzed
using High Performance Anion Exchange Chromatography
(HPAEC) using equipment and columns as described previously.11
Ten microliters of a 1 mg/mL sample solution was injected. Initial
eluent composition (0.3 mL/min) was 0.1 M NaOH, which was linearly
changed to 0.4 M NaOAc in 0.1 M NaOH in 30 min. After this,
the column was rinsed with 1 M NaOAc in 0.1 M NaOH for 5 min
followed by an equilibration at starting conditions for 18 min. Data
were processed using Chromeleon software (Dionex Corporation).
2.2.3. Synthesis of oligosaccharide-hydroxy-aryl esters
Oligosaccharides were transesterified with methyl 3-(4-
hydroxyphenyl)propionate (HPPME) by dissolving 0.7 mmol of oligosaccharide
together with 1.7 mmol of HPPME (ratio 1:2.3) and
25 mg of K2CO3 in 5 mL of DMSO in a 15 mL capped plastic reaction
tube. Reaction mixtures were subsequently incubated in a shaking
incubator (80 rpm) at 40 C for seven days. To study the influence
of the reagents on product yield and composition, a range of samples
with different reagent ratios was incubated under the same
conditions for four days. The reaction was stopped by cooling the
samples to 20 C until further analysis or purification.
2.2.4. Purification of the oligosaccharide-hydroxy-aryl esters
The hydroxy-arylated oligosaccharides in the reaction mixture
were precipitated by mixing 1 mL of the reaction mixture with
20 mL of dichloromethane. After centrifugation (5 min; 2540g,
room temperature), the supernatant was decanted and the precipitate
was washed with 10 mL of dichloromethane. The precipitate
was air-dried and subsequently dissolved in 8 mL of water (0 C).
This solution was used for purification by means of Solid Phase
Extraction (SPE). Sep-Pak Vac 20 cc (5 g) C18 Cartridges (Waters
Corporation, Milford, MA, USA) with a CV of 8 mL were activated
by rinsing with 3 CV of MeOH and 3 CV of water, respectively.
The 8 mL of sample solution was then loaded. After this, compounds
were eluted using successively: Water (6 CV), 10% (v/v)
MeOH in water (6 CV), 20% (v/v) MeOH in water (3 CV), 30%
(v/v) MeOH in water (3 CV), 40% (v/v) MeOH in water (3 CV),
and 60% (v/v) MeOH in water (3 CV). Fractions were collected
per 3 CV, dried using a stream of dry air, and weighted. Fractions
were subsequently dissolved in water to a concentration of 5 mg/
mL and analyzed by using RP-UPLC-MS. Fractions were stored at
20 C until further use.
2.2.5. U-HPLC-MS analysis of oligosaccharide-hydroxy-aryl
esters
The compositions of the reaction mixtures from oligosaccharide
hydroxy-arylation and the SPE fractions were determined using
U-HPLC-MS equipment and columns as described elsewhere.12
For the reaction mixture analysis, 3 lL of a 200-diluted sample
in DMSO was injected. For the SPE fractions, 5 lL of a 5 mg/mL
solution in water was injected. For elution (30 C), a gradient was
applied at 300 lL/min using the following two eluents: A: water
containing 1% (v/v) acetonitril and 1% (v/v) HOAc; B: acetonitril
containing 1% (v/v) HOAc. Gradient: 0–2 min: 95–80% A; 2–
9 min: 80–70% A; 9–11 min: 70–60% A; 11–15 min: 60–20% A;
15–16 min: 20–0% A; 16–18 min: 0% A isocratic; 18–22 min: 0–
95% A; 22–26 min: 95% A isocratic. Linear gradients were used in
all non-isocratic steps. Detection was performed by the PDA detector
scanning between 200 and 400 nm. Half of the eluent was led
to the ESI-MS system running in the negative mode. Helium was
used as a sheath gas and nitrogen as auxiliary gas. The capillary
temperature was set at 250 C and the spray voltage at 4.7 kV. Settings
of the MS were tuned using a purified saccharose-HPP monoester
sample. After each first scan event, being a full scan between
m/z 300–2000, MS/MS analysis was performed in a second scan
event for the most intense ion in the full MS spectrum, using normalized
collision energy of 35.0 units. During the first 3.5 min of
each run, eluent was directed to the waste in order to protect the MS from DMSO influx. Data were processed using XCalibur software
(Thermo Scientific).
2.2.6. NMR analysis of hydroxyl-arylated saccharose
Purified saccharose-HPP mono-ester (14 mg) was dissolved in
0.5 mL D2O containing 0.07% 3-(trimethylsilyl)-propionic-2,2,3,3-
d4 acid, sodium salt (TMSP). NMR spectra were recorded at a probe
temperature of 300 K on a Bruker Avance-III-600 spectrometer
(Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany), equipped with a cryo-probe
located at Biqualys (Wageningen, The Netherlands). Chemical
shifts are expressed in ppm relative to internal TMSP at
0.00 ppm. 1D and 2D COSY, TOCSY, HMBC, and HMQC spectra were
acquired using standard pulse sequences delivered by Bruker. For
the 1H-COSY and -TOCSY spectra, 400 experiments of 2 scans and
4 scans were recorded, resulting in measuring times of 0.5 and
1 h, respectively. The mixing time for the TOCSY spectra was
100 ms. For the [1H,13C]-HMBC and -HMQC spectra 800 experiments
of 24 scans and 512 experiments of 4 scans were recorded,
resulting in measuring times of 6.2 and 1.2 h, respectively.
2.2.7. Peroxidase-mediated coupling of hydroxy-arylated
oligosaccharides to tyrosine-containing peptides
The SPE-purified hydroxy-arylated oligosaccharides were linked
to the peptide GYG by using a method based on the work published
before.5 GYG (0.5 mg) was dissolved in 1 mL 0.1 M sodium phosphate
buffer pH 7.0 in a capped reaction tube. Then, 35 lL of a
1 mg/mL horseradish peroxidase solution was added. This was followed
by the addition of 8  3 lL of 0.5 M H2O2 and 8  15 lL of
HPPME (3 mg/mL) or oligosaccharide-HPP (5 mg/mL). Between
the 8 sets of additions, intervals of 20 min were applied. Samples
were incubated at 30 C at 400 rpm in an Eppendorf Thermomixer
(Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). Thirty minutes after the final
substrate addition, the reaction was stopped by adding 4 lL of a
1% (w/v) catalase solution. Samples were then stored at 20 C until
analysis.
2.2.8. Analysis of glycopeptides
Products of the peroxidase-catalyzed coupling of GYG to
HPPME or oligosaccharide-HPP compounds were also analyzed
using RP-UHPLC-PDA/MS. The system, column (30 C), flow rate,
and eluents used for analysis were the same as outlined under
Section 2.2.5. Ten microliters of the sample solutions, as obtained
under 2.2.7, was injected. The following linear gradients were
applied: 0–9 min: 98–80% A; 9–11 min: 80–65% A; 11–15 min:
65–20% A; 15–16 min: 20–0% A; 16–18 min: 0% A isocratic; 18–
22 min: 0–98% A; 22–26 min: 98% A isocratic. ESI-MS was run
in the positive mode. Helium was used as the sheath gas and
nitrogen as the auxiliary gas. The capillary temperature was set
at 350 C and the source voltage was 3.5 kV. Settings of the MS
were tuned using a solution of the peptide MRFA. After each first
scan event, being a full scan between m/z 100–2000, MS/MS analysis
was performed in a second scan event on the most intense
ion in the full MS spectrum, using normalized collision energy
of 35.0 units. Data were processed using XCalibur software
(Thermo Scientific).
