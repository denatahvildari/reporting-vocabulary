Gel permeation chromatography
The aggregation state of non-network protein was
analyzed at 20 8C by gel permeation chromatography
using a Superdex 200 column 10/30 (Pharmacia, Uppsala,
Sweden) attached to an FPLC system (Pharmacia, Uppsala,
Sweden). The elution buffer was equal to the sample buffer.
The flow rate was 1 ml/min and the eluate was monitored at
280 nm. The column was calibrated with a high molecular
weight gel filtration calibration kit (Pharmacia).
