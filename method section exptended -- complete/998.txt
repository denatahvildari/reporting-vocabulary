High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). The composition
of the whey protein samples was analyzed by HPLC, using a
Shodex KW 803 column at a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min (eluent 60%
MilliQ water, 40% acetonitrile, and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) with
detection at a wavelength of 220 nm. The samples were diluted with
eluent containing 8 M urea and filtered over 0.22 ??m membranes. For
data collection and calculation of the separate whey proteins in the
samples, PC1000 software (Thermo Separation Products GmbH,
Darmstadt, Germany) was used. The amounts of the separate whey
proteins were calculated using the area under the graphs, as calculated
with the software, after calibration with external standards.
