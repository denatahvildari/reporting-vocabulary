2.4. Fatty acid analysis
Fatty acid extraction and quantification were performed as described
by Lamers et al. (2010) and Santos et al. (2011), with the
exception that the cell pellets were immediately transferred to
bead-beating tubes after centrifugation and freeze dried before
analysis. A 30-min bead-beating time was used. The method is
based on extraction of lipids in chloroform:methanol, followed
by methylation of fatty acids to their methyl esters (FAMEs) and
quantification of FAMEs using gas chromatography, as described
in detail by Lamers et al. (2010) and Santos et al. (2011). Tripentadecanoin
was used as an internal standard for fatty acid quantification.
Total fatty acid concentration was calculated as the sum of all
individual fatty acids.
2.5. Triacylglycerol analysis
Total lipids were extracted as described in Section 2.4 and dissolved
in 0.5 ml hexane. TAGs were purified from this mixture
using an SPE silica gel cartridge (Waters; product number
186004617). The cartridge was pre-washed with 6 ml hexane
and subsequently the sample was loaded onto the cartridge. TAGs
were eluted using 10 ml 87:13 (%v/v) hexane:diethylether. TAG
content in the undiluted eluent was quantified using gas chromatography
(Fisons instuments GC-8610 with FID detector; column:
Varian CP-Sil-5 low bleed (CB-MS) (CP7858), 10 m  0.32 mm ID,
DF = 0.12 lm (COL-GC-265); carrier gas: H2; column pressure:
30 kPa 3.7 ml/min (constant flow); FID pressures H2: 50 kPa,
air: 100 kPa, make-up N2: 80???100 ml/min; temperature profile:80 C (2 min), 10 C /min, 360 C (5 min); detector temp: FID
370 C; injector volume: 1.0 ll). Tripentadecanoin was used as an
internal standard and TAG concentration was calculated using
the area of the internal standard. A representative chromatogram
is shown in Supplementary materials 1.
TAG fatty acid composition was determined by evaporation of
all solvents in the eluent followed by methylation of the residue
and quantification of FAMEs using gas chromatography, as described
in Section 2.4.
