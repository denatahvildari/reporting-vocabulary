2.6. Reversed phase-high performance liquid chromatography
The effect of microfluidization on native b-lg was investigated
using reversed phase-high performance liquid chromatography
(RP-HPLC). The chromatographic system consisted of an Agilent
1200 series binary pump with standard auto sampler, a thermostatic
column department and a 1200 series diode array detector
(Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Separation of the b-lg
fractions was achieved using an Agilent 300 SB-C18 RP Poroshell
column. The injection volume of the sample was 5 mL (10 g L1
protein concentration), the flow rate being 0.5 mL min1 and the
column temperature was set at 35 C. Solvent A consisted of
a 900:100:1 (by vol) mixture of water, acetonitrile and trifluoroacetic
(TFA), while solvent B was a 900:89.1:0.9 (by vol) mixture of
acetonitrile, water and TFA. A solvent gradient was generated after
injection, starting at 26% B and increasing to 37% B after 10 min1,
the proportion of B then increased to 45% after 13 min1 10 s1 and subsequently to 100% B after 3 min1 40 s1. This was held for
3 min1, before returning to starting conditions. After the microfluidization
treatment, b-lg dispersions were centrifuged (3700  g
for 30 min at 25 C) to remove the denatured protein and the
supernatant was filtered and used for HPLC analysis. The b-lg
samples were prepared by dilution (v/v) using a disassociating
buffer containing 7 M urea, 0.02 M bis-Tris-propane and 0.5% mercaptoethanol
(Visser, Slangen, & Rollema, 1991). The samples were
left at room temperature for at least 1 h in the disassociating buffer
before being passed through a 0.22 mm filter to remove any insoluble
material. Data were collected at 214 and 280 nm and quantificationwas
based on integration of the data at 214 nm. Commercial
b-lg (Sigma Aldrich) and WPI (Bipro) were used as standards.
The experiments were run with b-lg since a pure protein is
required for the analysis. The results can be extrapolated for WPI
samples since previous studies indicate that only b-lg forms fibrils
at low pH and ionic strength (Akkermans et al., 2008b; Ikeda &
Morris, 2002; Oboroceanu et al., 2010).
