MATERIALS AND METHODSBacterial Strains and Growth ConditionsDNAcloning was performed using the E. coli strain XL1 blueMRF’ (Promega, Madison, WI). The E. coli strain was grownin Luria-Bertani (LB) broth or solidified LB medium (15 gagar/L) supplemented with 100 mg/mL ampicillin, whenappropriate.The E. coli cells containing the AGA gene (aga)and the mutants were grown in LB broth or solidifiedLB medium supplemented with 100 mg/mLampicillin and 1 mM isopropyl b-D-thiogalactopyranoside(IPTG). Chemicals, Substrates, and EnzymesChemicals and substrates were purchased from Sigma (St.Louis, MO) unless stated otherwise. Restriction enzymes andother enzymes used for DNA manipulation were obtainedfrom MBI Fermentas (St. Leon Rot, Germany) and wereused according to the instructions of the manufacturer.Cloning of the Wild-Type aga GeneThe wild-type AGA gene from B. adolescentis DSM 20083,was described by Van den Broek et al. (1999). A polymerasechain reaction (PCR) was carried out with Pfu-turbopolymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to obtain the agaopen reading frame of the wild-type gene. Two primers wereused for amplification of the aga gene (XbaI and HindIIIrestriction sites were introduced at the beginning and at theend of the gene, respectively, for cloning purpose). Primersused were (with the restriction sites underlined): AR1GAL(50-GCGCTCTAGAGCAATGACGCTCATTCA), and AR2REVGAL (50-CGCGAAGCTTTACTCAGATGCGGACTA).The forth-coming DNA fragments were ligated into a XbaI/HindIII digested pBluescript vector (Stratagene) or pETBluePerfectly Blunt Vector (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany).The recombinant plasmid was transformed into E. coli XL1blue MRF’ cells for expression. Construction of MutantsThe QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene)was used to make selected point mutations according tothe instructions of the manufacturer. For each single mutant,a sense/antisense primer pair was designed, which includedsilent mutations encoding restriction sites to verify theinserted mutations (sense primer, introduced mutations inboldface, codon for mutated amino acid italic, restrictionsites underlined, and restriction enzymes in parentheses):D380N (50-GGAACGCTTCGTCGTGAACGATGGCTGGTTCGGCGCCCGCCG-30) (NarI); D381N (50-GGAACGCTTCGTCGTGGATAACGGCTGGTTCGGCGCCCGCCG-30) (NarI); G382C (50-TCGTGGATGATTGCTGGTTCGGAGCCCGCCGAGAC-30) (BanI); F384L(50-GTGGATGATGGCTGGCTCGGAGCCCGCCGAGAC-30) (BanI); Y492A (50-CGGCGAACTCGGCATCGATGCCATCAAATGGGATCAC-30) (ClaI); Y492G(50CGGCGAACTCGGCATCGATGGCATCAAATGGATGGGATCAC-30) (ClaI); W495L (50-CGGC-ATCGATTACATCAAATTGGATCACAACAAATACGTCACCG-30) (ClaI); W495Y (50-GCTGGTCGGCATCGATTACATCAAATACGATCACAACAAATACG-30)(ClaI); H497M (50-CGGCATCGATTACATCAAATGGGATATGAACAAATACGTCACCG-30) (ClaI); N498C(50-CGGCATCGATTACATCAAATGGGATCACTGCAAATACGTCACCG-30) (ClaI); Y500L (50-GGATCACAACAAACTCGTCACCGAAGCGGTGTCGCCGCGGACCGG-30) (SacII). The wild-type AGA gene (aga) was used as the template DNA. For each double mutant, asense/antisense primer pair of the single mutants was used,accept for Y492G-H497M (50-CGAACTCGGCATCGATGGCATCAAATGGGATATGAACAAAT-30, template:mutant Y492G), and H497M-Y500L (50-ATCGACTACATCAAATGGGATATGAACAAACTCGTCACCGA-30,template: mutant H497M).Plasmid DNA was isolated by following the Qiagenplasmid purification method (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).Positive colonies were selected according to the restrictionpattern of the plasmids upon digestion with the specificrestriction enzyme for the silent mutation. To verify, if thepoint mutation was actually introduced, the DNA–nucleotidesequence of the plasmid was determined. Afterverification, the desired mutant plasmid was transformed toE. coli XL1 blue MRF’ cells.Isolation and Characterization of MutantsCells from an E. coli cell culture (1 L, LB-medium, 378C,overnight) containing the wild-type or mutated aga geneswere harvested by centrifugation (10 min; 3,000g; 48C). Thesupernatant was removed and used for activity measurement;the cells were suspended in 40 mL 20mMsodium phosphatebuffer pH 7 and disrupted by sonic treatment (10 min;amplitude 30%, duty cycle 0.3 s on, 0.7 s off; Digital Sonifier,Branson, Danbury, CT) on ice. Subsequently, the suspensionwas centrifuged (10 min; 13,000g; 48C), the cell extract wascollected, and the pellet suspended in 40 mL 20 mM sodiumphosphate buffer pH 7 and a second sonic treatment wasperformed. The cell extracts were pooled and applied onto aQ-Sepharose Hiload 26/10 (Amersham, Little Chalfont, UK)anion-exchange column. Elution took place with a lineargradient of 0–0.5MNaCl in 20mM sodium phosphate pH 7at a flow rate of 4 mL/min. Fractions with the highest AGAactivity were pooled and further purified on a Superdex200 PG Hiload 16/26 (Amersham) size-exclusion column.Elution was performed with 0.15 M NaCl in 20 mMpotassium phosphate buffer pH 7.0 at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. Fractions with the highest AGA activity were pooledand concentrated with anion-exchange chromatographyunder the same conditions as described above.Protein concentration was determined by the method ofBradford (1976) using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as astandard. SDS–PAGE was carried out on the PharmaciaPhastsystem according to the instructions of the supplier(Amersham). Coomassie brilliant blue staining was used forthe detection of proteins on PhastGel 8%–25% gradient gels(Amersham).Enzyme AssaysSide activity of the purified enzymes was measured bydetermining the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl-a-D-glycosides(pNP-a-L-arabinopyranoside, pNP-a-L-arabinofuranoside,pNP-b-D-xylopyranoside, pNP-a-D-glucopyranoside, pNPb-D-glucopyranoside, pNP-b-D-fucopyranoside, and pNP-a-L-rhamnopyranoside) at 378C after 10 min incubation. Thereaction mixture (125 mL) consisted of 2 mM potassiumphosphate buffer pH 6.0, and 0.2 mg/mL pNP-glycosidesolution. The reaction was stopped by adding an equalvolume of 0.5 M glycine/NaOH buffer pH 9.0, containing2 mM EDTA. The color formation was measured at 400 nm.a-galactosidase activity was measured by determiningthe hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl-a-D-galactopyranoside(pNP-Gal) under the conditions mentioned above. One unit(U) of activity was defined as the amount of enzyme thatliberates 1 mmol of galactose per min under the specifiedconditions. The molar extinction coefficient of p-nitrophenolunder these assay conditions was 13,700/Mcm.Optimal transglycosylation conditions of the wild-typeaga were measured with 0.04 UAGA and 300mMmelibiosein McIlvain buffer (0.1 M citric acid/0.2 M di-sodiumphosphate), in a total volume of 100 mL. The enzyme’soptimal transglycosylation pH determined with McIlvainbuffers in the range of pH 3–8 and a temperature of 408Cduring 4 h. For determination of the optimal transglycosylationtemperature, temperatures between 20 and 708C wereused for incubation at pH 8 during 4 h. After incubation, thesamples were 10 times diluted with McIlvain buffer pH 5, andwere stopped by heating the incubation mixtures for 5 minat 1008C. All reactions were carried out in duplicate. Aftercentrifugation (10 min, 10,000g) the supernatant wasanalyzed by high-performance anion-exchange chromatography(HPAEC).Acceptor specificity was measured with 300 mM melibiose,300 mM acceptor substrate, 0.04 U AGA in McIlvainbuffer pH 8, in a total volume of 100 mL at 408C during 7 h.The incubations were diluted, stopped, and analyzed asdescribed before. All reactions were carried out in duplicate.Transglycosylation activity was measured with 600 mMmelibiose, 0.04 U AGA (the amount of units added, wascalculated from the hydrolytic activity towards pNP-Gal forboth wild-type and mutant AGA) in 100mMTris-HCl bufferpH 8, in a total volume of 100 mL at 408C during 7 h. Theincubations were diluted, stopped, and analyzed as describedbefore. All reactions were carried out in triplicate.
