2.3.2. Sugar composition, total neutral sugar and total uronic acid
contents
Sugar compositionwas determined according to De Ruiter, Schols,
Voragen, and Rombouts (1992). Samples were dried at 40 C under
vacuum over P2O5 and hydrolyzed with 2 N HCl in dry methanol
for 16 h at 80 C followed by evaporation and subsequent 2 M
TFA hydrolysis at 121 C for 1 h. Monomeric sugars were analyzed
using high-performance anion-exchange chromatography  pulsed
amperometric detection (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) analysis
as described previously (Sengkhamparn, Verhoef, Schols,
Sajjaanantakul, & Voragen, 2009). Total neutral sugar contents
were determined with the orcinol-sulfuric acid colour assay (Tollier
& Robin, 1979) and uronic acids contents with the m-hydroxydiphenyl
assay (Ahmed & Labavitch,1978), both using an automated
colorimetric assay analyser. As standards galactose or glucose (25e
200 mg/mL) and galacturonic acid (12.5e100.0 mg/mL) were used,
respectively.
2.3.3. Size exclusion chromatography
Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) was performed on a ??KTA
micro liquid chromatography system equipped with a Superose 6
column (both GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden). The samples
(50 mL, w10 mg/mL protein) were eluted with 50 mM Tris/HCl
buffer (pH 8) containing 150 mM NaCl at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min
at room temperature. Elution was monitored by UV detection at
280 nm (internal detector) and by refractive index detection
(Shodex RI150, Showa Denko K.K., Tokyo, Japan). Apparent molecular
weights were estimated using a high molecular weight gel
filtration calibration kit (GE Healthcare).
