2.1. Preparation and analysis of wheat straw
Wheat straw (harvest September 2006, Delfzijl, The Netherlands)
was milled twice; first in a Pallmann mill (4mm????30mm
sieve) and then in a Retsch mill (1mm sieve). Milled straw
was kept in a sealed plastic barrel at room temperature until
used. Chemical composition was analyzed as described by TAPPI
methods [25???30], with minor modifications: (1) samples were
extracted with ethanol:toluene 2:1, 96% (v/v) ethanol and hot
water (1 h) at boiling temperature. (2) The extracted samples
were dried at 60 ???C for 16 h. (3) Monomeric sugar and
lignin content of the ethanol-extracted material was determined
after a two-step hydrolysis with sulfuric acid (12M for 1 h at
30 ???C; 1M for 3h at 100???C). (4) Acid soluble lignin in the
hydrolyzatewas determined by spectrophotometric determination
at 205 nm.
Monomeric sugars were measured by HPAEC-PAD (High
Performance Anion Exchange Chromatography with Pulsed Amperometric
Detection). A Dionex system with Carbopak PA1 column
with pre-columnwas usedat 30 ???C, with de-ionizedwater as mobile
phase (1 mL/min) and fucose as internal standard. The Dionex HPLC
methodwas also usedfor determination ofmonomericsugars in the
aqueous phase of both pretreated and enzymatically hydrolyzed
wheat straw. Dry matter content was 91.8% (w/w) (24 h at 105 ???C).
