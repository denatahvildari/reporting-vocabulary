EXPERIMENTAL
 Materials
Amylose-enriched maize starch (AEMS; 70% amylose),
racemic allyl glycidyl ether (AGE) (99%),
and methyl a-D-glucopyranoside (MG) were purchased
from Sigma–Aldrich Chemie BV (the Netherlands).
Waxy maize starch (WMS; 0% amylose)
was obtained from Fluka Biochemika (Switzerland).
a-Amylase (product no. 10069, from Bacillus
subtilis; 393 U/mg) was purchased from Fluka
(Switzerland). Pullulanase (M2, from Bacillus
licheniformis; 400 U/mL) was obtained from Megazyme
(Ireland). Amyloglucosidase (A9268, from Aspergillus
oryzae; 1400 U/mL) was obtained from
Sigma (United States).
 Synthesis of 1-Allyloxy-2-hydroxy-propyl-methyl
a -D -Glucopyranoside (AHP-MG)
MG (1.93 g, 9.94 mmol) and NaOH (0.0030 g,
0.08 mmol) were suspended in distilled water
(6 mL) in a 20-mL carousel reaction tube, and the
mixture was heated to 44 8C. The reaction was
initiated by the addition of AGE (4.75 mL, 40.0
mmol) dropwise over a period of 15 min, and the
mixture was stirred vigorously for 16 h. The solution
was then cooled in ice water and neutralized
to pH 7.0 with 2.5 M HCl. AGE was removed by
extraction with ether (3 3 10 mL). Subsequent
freeze drying gave 1.90 g of a white powder as a
mixture of AHP-MG (15.8%) and MG.

 Synthesis of AHP-Starch
A general procedure for the synthesis of AHPstarch
was as follows: Amylose-enriched starch
(25.01 g, 17% moisture, 154.4 mmol of AGUs) was
suspended in distilled water (100 mL) in a 250-mL,
round-bottom flask. NaOH (0.48 g, 12 mmol) and
Na2SO4 (10 g, 70.4 mmol) were added, and the
mixture was heated to 44 8C. The reaction
was initiated by the addition of AGE (8.77 mL,
73.9 mmol) dropwise over a period of 30 min, and
the mixture was stirred vigorously for 16 h at
44 8C. The suspension was then cooled in ice
water and neutralized to pH 7.0 with 2.5 M HCl.
After filtration (sintered glass filter, G3), the
product was washed with water (3 3 150 mL),
ethanol (3 3 150 mL), and acetone (3 3 150 mL)
and dried overnight in an oven at 60 8C to yield a
white powder of AHP-AEMS (29.14 g, 17% moisture).
1H NMR (300 MHz, DMSO, d, ppm): 5.90 (1H,
H-11); 5.20 (2H, H-12); 4.93 (1H, H-1); 3.95 (1H,
H-8 and 2H, H-10); 3.76 and 3.66 (2H, H-6); 3.50–
2.95 (H-2 to H-5, H-7 and H-9). 13C NMR
(100 MHz, D2O, d, ppm): 136.2 (C-11); 117.3 (C-
12); 100.9 (C-1); 79.6 (C-4); 74.1 (C-3); 72.9 (C-2);
72.5 (C-5); 71.2 (C-8 and C-9); 69.9 (C-10); 61.1 (C-
6 and C-7).
 Characterization
1H and 13C NMR spectra were acquired with a
Bruker DPX300 300-MHz spectrometer. 2D NMR  spectra were recorded on a Bruker DPX400
400-MHz spectrometer. Unless otherwise stated,
all NMR measurements were carried out with
DMSO-d6  as a solvent. Proton and carbon chemical
shifts (d ) are given in parts per million toward
tetramethylsilane.
The moisture content determinations were carried
out with a Karl Fischer titrator, a Metrohm
720 KFS Titrino (Metrohm, Switzerland) connected
to a Metrohm 703 Ti Stand electrode
holder, and a built-in magnetic stirrer for the
sample location.
High-performance size exclusion chromatography
(HPSEC) was carried out in a ThermoFinnigan
(United States) HPLC apparatus with three TSKgel
columns (7.8-mm i.d. 3  30 cm per column) in series
(G4000PWXL , G3000 PWXL , and G2500PWXL , Tosohaas,
Japan), in combination with a PWXL -guard
column (Tosohaas). Elution took place at 30 8 C with
0.2 M sodium nitrate at a flow rate of 0.8 mL/min
and was monitored with a refractive-index detector
(Spectra System RI 150, Thermo Electron Corp.,
Italy). The software ChromQuest was obtained
from ThermoFinnigan.12
 High-performance anion exchange chromatography
(HPAEC) was performed on a Dionex
(United States) HPLC system. The system was
equipped with a quaternary gradient pump, an
AS3000 autosampler complete with a helium
degassing unit, and an ED40 EC detector in a
pulsed amperometric detection mode (PAD) mode.
A CarboPac PA1 column (2 3  250 mm; Dionex)
with a CarboPac PA1 guard column (2 3  50 mm;
Dionex) was operated at a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min
at 20 8 C. The gradient was obtained by solutions
of 1 M NaOAc in 0.1 M NaOH being mixed with
0.1 M NaOH. After 15 min of equilibration with
0.1 M NaOH, 20 l L of the sample was injected,
and a linear gradient to 0.50 M NaOAc in 0.1 M
NaOH within 30 min was followed by a linear
gradient in 5 min to 1 M NaOAc in 0.1 M NaOH.
Finally, the column was washed for 5 min with 1
M NaOAc in 0.1 M NaOH. The data were processed
with a Chromeleon (Dionix) data handling
system.12
 Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization
time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF
MS) was carried out with an ultraflex workstation
(Bruker Daltonics GmbH, Germany) equipped
with a nitrogen laser of 337 nm. The mass spectrometer
was selected for positive ions. After a
delayed extraction of 100 ns, the ions were accelerated
to a kinetic energy of 20 kV. Hereafter, the
ions were detected in the reflector mode. The lowest
laser power required to obtain good spectra was
used. The mixture of the 1-l L sample and 1 l L of
the matrix were dried on a sample plate. The matrix
solution was prepared by the dissolution of
9 mg of 2,5-dihydroxybenzonic acid in a 1-mL mixture
of acetonitrile and water (3:7). External calibration
was performed with a mixture of maltodextrins
(Mw  range .  400–3500 Da).13
 SEM micrographs were obtained on a JEOL
JSM-6300 scanning electron microscope. The vacuum-
dried samples were attached to circular silver
stubs with double-sided tape on a carbon
sticker and coated with a platinum sputter using
a JEOL JFC-1200 fine coater (Tokyo, Japan).
Samples were viewed through the scanning of the
total specimen, and a representative area was
photographed at magnifications in ranges up to
60003 .
X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra were obtained on
a Philips (the Netherlands) X-Pert ProMRD apparatus
under N2 . A dry sample was spread on a thin
glass (ca. 15 l m), which was then placed on a temperature-
regulated flat copper sample stage. The relative
crystallinity was determined after normalization
of all recorded spectra.14  Diffractograms were
interpreted in terms of polymorphs A, B, and C.14–18
DS
 The degree of substitution (DS) of the AHP derivatives
was determined by the integration of 1 H
NMR spectra using maleic acid (MA) as an internal
standard. MA gives a singlet for 2 H atoms at
6.2 ppm in 1 H NMR spectra. The DS, expressed
as moles of allyl residues per mole of glucose
units, was determined with the peak at 5.9 ppm
attributed to H-11 from the allyl starch ether
according to equation 1  where xMA  and IMA  are the molarity and integrated
peak area of MA, respectively; IAHP  is the
integrated peak area of AGE; and xAGU  is the molarity
of AGUs (in starch).
Another determination of DS is based on an
adapted double-bond titration method.19  This
method is performed with a standard base–acid
titration connected to the computer program
TPC2000. Briefly, allyl starch ether undergoes a
reaction with mercuric acetate in methanol. The
liberated acetic acid is proportional to the amount
of double bonds in AHP-starch.  Enzymatic Degradation
In the enzyme preparation, a-amylase was dissolved
in deionized water purified by Millipore
(United Kingdom), pullulanase was diluted in a
sodium acetate buffer (0.01 M, pH 5.0), and amyloglucosidase
was diluted in a sodium acetate
buffer (0.01 M, pH 4.5) to make solutions containing
0.38, 0.22, and 0.14 U/lL, respectively. These
enzyme solutions were used in the degradation of
the native starch and its derivatives.
The enzymatic digestion was as follows: AHPstarch
(5 mg, 0.02 mmol) was dissolved in 1 mL of
a sodium acetate buffer (0.01 M pH 5.0) and incubated
sequentially with pullulanase (5 lL) at
40 8C for 8 h, with a-amylase (5 lL) at 25 8C for
8 h, and with amyloglucosidase at 55 8C for 8 h.
After completion, each reaction step was stopped
by boiling for 10 min.
