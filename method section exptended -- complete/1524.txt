 2. Materials and methods
2.1. Chemicals
A40926 tert-BOC and deacyl-A40926 tert-BOC (in further
text A40926 and deacyl-A40926) were prepared as previously
described [5]. Acetonitrile (Carlo Erba, Milan, Italy)
was of HPLC grade, and all other reagents were of analytical
grade unless otherwise indicated.
 2.2. Organism and culture conditions
Actinoplanes teichomyceticus ATCC 31121 was maintained
in a frozen vegetative state at ???80 ???C. The stock
cultures were used as inoculums (2.5% v/v) for 100 ml
pre-culture medium S/Bis (in g/l: glucose 10, bacto peptone
4, bacto yeast extract 4, MgSO4????7H2O 0.5, K2HPO4
4) in a 500 ml baffled Erlenmeyer flask. Pre-culture flasks
were grown for 72 h at 28 ???C on a rotary shaker at 200 rpm,
and used as inoculums in subsequent experiments. For the
kinetic experiments, washed cells of  A. teichomyceticus
were prepared in the following way: 500 ml baffled shake
flasks containing 100 ml of AUR/M medium (in g/l: maltose
20, dextrin 10, meat extract 4, yeast extract 2, peptone
4, soybean meal 15, CaCO3 2) were inoculated with 4ml
of pre-culture and incubated at 28 ???C on a rotary shaker at
200 rpm. After 72 h of growth cultures were washed twice
with 20mM Tris???HCl buffer (pH 7.0) and resuspended in
100 ml Tris???HCl buffer in a 500 ml shake flasks.
 2.3. Kinetic measurements
For determination of kinetic parameters substrate conversion
was measured as a function of time. In two independent
experiments, 10 different initial substrate concentrations
were used. A total of 22 shake flasks with washed cells
of  A. teichomyceticus (as described above) were used for
kinetic experiments and dry cell weight determinations. At
t = 0 h, different amounts of A40926 sodium salt, previously
dissolved in sterile water at a concentration of 25 g/l,
were added to each pair of shake flasks to yield desired
initial substrate concentrations. The culture flasks were incubated
at 28 ???C on a rotary shaker at 200 rpm. Samples
were collected at regular time intervals and analyzed by
HPLC. All measurements were carried out in duplicate. The
initial reaction rates were determined by linear regression.
 The reaction rates are expressed in moles of deacyl-A40926
formed per kilogram of dry cell weight per second.
2.4. Kinetic calculations
 Previous studies suggest that the deacylation of A40926
by A. teichomyceticus  cells can be described by Michaelis???
Menten kinetics [4] . To determine kinetic parameters, a
 simple Michaelis???Menten expression (Eq. (1) ) was used:
V = Vmax
Cs
Km + Cs
 (1)
where V  is the initial reaction rate (mol g???1  h???1 ), Vmax  is the
maximum reaction rate (mol g???1  h???1 ), Cs  is the substrate
concentration (mol l???1 ), and Km  is the Michaelis constant
(mol l???1 ). Parameter estimation was done by fitting Eq. (1)
 to experimental data pairs of substrate concentrations versus
initial reaction rates. TableCurve 2D, (Version 3 for Windows,
Jandel Scientific) software was used for data fitting
and statistical analysis.
2.5. Method of immobilization
Actinoplanes teichomyceticus  cells were immobilized in
calcium alginate gel by a procedure previously described [5] .
All work was carried out in a laminar-air-flow cabinet. The
diameter of the beads was measured using a Leitz Wetzlar
stereoscope with micrometer ocular (10????  magnification).
The average bead diameter (dmean ???? S. D. ) determined from
a sample of 120 beads was 2. 05???? 0. 11 mm. Beads with two
gel loads, 53 and 28 kg of dry cell weight per cubic meter
of gel, respectively, were obtained and used in two ALR
experiments.
2.6. Analyses
 Concentration of biomass in a suspension and in the immobilized
beads was estimated by dry weight measurements
described elsewhere [5] . The concentration of A40926 and
deacyl-A40926 was determined by an external standard procedure
using analytical reference substances prepared in our
laboratories. HPLC analytical method, sample preparation,
and calculation procedure used were previously described
[5] .
2.7. ALR experiments
 The vessel used in this study was a glass made,
internal-loop ALR constructed by the glass workshop of
Wageningen University (The Netherlands). The working
volume of the reactor was 0.43 l (a cross-section of the
ALR is given in Fig. 2 ). The temperature in the reactor was
kept constant at 28 ??? C by circulating water in the jacket.
A Gilson Minipuls 2 peristaltic pump controlled incoming
and outgoing liquid flow. To prevent excessive foaming a
Bioengineering antifoam control system was applied with
a silicone based antifoam agent. Aeration was executed by
sterile air, supplied through the ceramic porous sparger at
the bottom of the ALR at a flow rate of 0.21 l min???1 . The
ALR was operated continuously twice for 21 days. The inlet
substrate concentration was 2. 04 ????  10???1  molm???3 . The
flow rates employed were 1. 5 ????  10???9  m3  s???1  in the first
experimental run and 2. 5 ????  10???9  m3  s???1  in the second experiment.
In both experiments, reactor gel hold-up was 20%
(v/v). Biocatalyst gel load in the first experimental run was  53 kgm???3  gel while in the second run 28 kgm???3  gel was
used. Beads were kept in the reactor by a Teflon sieve at
the overflow of the ALR. Two samples of 1ml were taken
daily to monitor substrate and product concentration.
