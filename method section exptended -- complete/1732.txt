 HPLC analysis of carotenoids
Separation and chromatographic analysis of pigments was
performed using a Merck Hitachi HPLC equipped with a
UV???Vis detector as described in [23 ], using an RP-18
column and flow rate of 1 mL min-1 . The mobile phase
consisted of ethyl acetate (solvent A) and acetonitrile/water
(9:1 v/v) (solvent B), and the gradient program applied was:
0???16 min, 0???60% A and 100???40% B; 16???30 min, 60% A
and 40%B; 30???35 min, 100% A. Detection of pigments was
carried out at 450 nm, and their identification and quantification
was achieved by previously running in the HPLC
known amounts of pigment standards (calibration curves).
The standards were supplied by DHI-Water and Environment
(Denmark), including chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b,
violaxanthin, zeaxanthin, lutein, and b -carotene of highpurity
grade ([ 99%). From the corresponding calibration
curves of the pigment standards, the following factors were
obtained and used to calculate carotenoid concentrations
in the samples (l g mL-1 ): chlorophyll a, 5.13 9  10-6 ;
chlorophyll b, 5.88 9  10-7 ; violaxanthin, 3.69 9  10-7 ;
zeaxanthin, 2.84 9  10-7 ; lutein, 3.63 9  10-7 ; andb -carotene,
3.09 9  10-7 .
