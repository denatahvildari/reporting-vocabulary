 2. Experimental
2.1. Production of enzyme degrading colanic acid
Cultures degrading colanic acid were obtained by
enrichment cultivation of a sample of compost, containing
paper machine fines, chicken manure and wood
bark. The enrichment medium contained 5 g/L colanic
acid from a Citrobacter sp. (VTT E-011941, produced
as described in12) and 6.7 g/L yeast nitrogen base (Difco)
in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7. About 1 g
of mechanically homogenised compost sample was
suspended in 5 mL of physiological NaCl solution, the
suspension was mixed and the solids were allowed to
settle. Suspension (250 lL) was inoculated in 5 mL of
enrichment medium. Sterile water was added to the reference
cultures instead of compost sample. Enrichment
cultures were incubated at 50 C without mixing for
3 days. Polysaccharide-degrading activity was detected
by following the decrease in the viscosity using a
Brookfield DV II viscometer (+20 C, sample size
0.5 mL). When the viscosity in the 1st enrichment culture
had clearly decreased, 250 lL of culture medium
was re-inoculated into 5 mL of fresh enrichment medium.
After 3 day of cultivation when the viscosity of
the second enrichment culture was lowered, 500 lL
of the culture medium was re-inoculated into 10 mL
of fresh medium for the third enrichment culture. After
1–2 days of incubation the enrichment cultures were
stored in the culture medium at +4 C for immediate
use or stored in 5% glycerol at 80 C for longer
periods.
 2.2. Activity assay
To follow the purification and to measure the kinetic
parameters of the enzyme, the bicinchoninic acid (BCA)
assay according to Meeuwsen et al.13 was used. The substrate
solution consisted of 0.5 mg/mL colanic acid in
50 mM phosphate buffer pH 7. This substrate solution
was mixed with variable amounts of enzyme solution until
a total volume of 100 lL and was incubated at variable
temperatures. The amount of reducing sugars released
upon degradation was determined using a fucose calibration
curve (5–500 lM). Specific activities were expressed
as U/mg protein where U stands for lmol reducing sugar
released per minute. The protein content was measured
according to Bradford14 using bovine serum albumin as
a standard.
 2.3. Anion exchange chromatography
The crude culture filtrate was ultra-filtered (Amicon
10 kDa cut off) and washed with Millipore water
(<20 lS/cm2) followed by 25 mM Tris/HCl buffer
pH = 7 and then applied on a Mono Q 5/50 GL
(Amersham Biosciences) anion exchange column
equilibrated with the same buffer. The protein was
eluted from the column by increasing the ionic strength
at a flow rate of 1 mL/min from 0 to 1 M NaCl in
20 column volumes, and fractions (0.5 mL) were
collected.

 2.4. Gel permeation chromatography
The pool containing enzyme activity after MonoQ separation
was applied to a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200
Prepgrade (Amersham Biosciences) gel filtration column
and eluted at 1 mL/min using 100 mM Tris/HCl buffer
pH 7.0 and fractions (2 mL) were collected.
 2.5. pH optimum and temperature optimum
The pH optimum was determined in McIlvaine buffers
in the pH range from 3 to 8. The colanic acid solutions
(1 mL; 0.5 mg/mL) were incubated with 20 lL of enzyme
solution (pooled after Superdex 200 separation;
23 lg protein/mL) at 30 C for 5 h. The temperature
optimum was measured using 0.5 mg/mL colanic acid
in 50 mM phosphate buffer pH 7 in the range from 20
to 80 C. The colanic acid solutions (1 mL) were incubated
with 25 lL of the same enzyme pool for 5 h. Temperature
stability was measured by first heating 20 lL of
the same enzyme solution at the same temperature range
without substrate for 1 h, followed by addition of 1 mL
0.5 mg/mL colanic acid in 50 mM phosphate buffer pH 7
and 5 h incubation at 30 C.
 2.6. Native and SDS-PAGE
SDS-PAGE was run on a PhastGelTM Gradient 4–15%
gel (Phastsystem), using low-molecular weight protein
standards from Amersham Biosciences. The gel was
stained using silver staining. Native PAGE was run
using a BioRad MiniProtean electrophoresis unit on a
5–15% gradient PAGE gel (ready gel BioRad). Part
of the gel was Coomasie stained and three unstained
lanes were cut into slices of 2 mm. The sections from
one lane were incubated with 1 mL 0.5 mg/mL colanic
acid (30 C, 50 mM phosphate buffer pH 7, 18 h) to
determine the active protein band. The BCA reducing
sugar assay as well as HPSEC were used for analysis
of degradation products. The other two lanes were used
for enzyme and substrate blanks. After incubation of
the enzyme blank, the enzyme diffused into the buffer.
This active enzyme fraction was concentrated and
subjected to SDS-PAGE under denaturing conditions
with and without prior reduction with b-mercaptoethanol.
 2.7. Substrate modifications
Native colanic acid was obtained as described by Verhoef
et al.3 Colanic acid was de-O-acetylated by dissolving
60 mg of colanic acid in 25 mL 100 mM NaOH and
stirring for 18 h at 4 C. After this saponification, the de-
O-acetylated substrate was dialysed by ultra-filtration
using a 10 kDa cut off Amicon filter. The ultra filtrated
solution was freeze dried to obtain the de-O-acetylated
substrate. Colanic acid (60 mg) was depyruvated as described
by Verhoef et al.15 using autohydrolysis.
 2.8. MALDI-TOFmass spectrometry
MALDI-TOF MS(matrix-as sisted laser desorption/
ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry) and Post
Source Decay (PSD)/MALDI-TOF MS was performed
on an Ultraflex workstation (Bruker Daltronics GmbH,
Germany). MALDI-TOF MSspectr a were recorded in
the negative mode using a mixture of galacturonic acid
oligosaccharides for calibration. PSD/MALDI-TOF
MSwas recorded in the positive mode using a mixture
of malto-dextrins for calibration. The samples were
mixed with a matrix solution (1 lL of sample in 9 lL
of matrix). The matrix solution was prepared by dissolving
9 mg of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid in a 1 mL
mixture of acetonitrile–water (300:700 lL). Of the prepared
sample and matrix solution 2 lL was put on a
gold plate and dried with warm air.
 2.9. HPSEC of colanic acid
Colanic acid (2 mg) was dissolved in 1 mL of distilled
water and analysed by high-performance size exclusion
chromatography (HPSEC) using three TOSOHAAS
TSK-Gel columns in series (4000-, 3000-, 2500-PWXL)
preceded by a TSK guard column (40 · 6 mm) according
to Verhoef et al.3
