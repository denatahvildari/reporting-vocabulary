MATERIALS AND METHODSChemicals. pNP-hexanoate, S-methyl thiobutanoate, ethyl-hexanoate, 5,5-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB), 3,3-diaminobenzidine, and chloramphenicolwere purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). Nisin powder(nisin content, 2.5%) was purchased from ICN.Bacterial strains, media, and growth conditions. L. lactis cells were grown at30°C in M17 medium (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) supplemented with 0.5%(wt/vol) glucose. When needed, chloramphenicol (10 g ml1) was added to themedium.Enzyme purification. EST2 and EstA were purified as previously described byManco et al. (30) and Fernandez et al. (12), respectively.Cloning and overexpression of EST2 in L. lactis. The expression vectorpNZ7408 was obtained by cloning the EST2 gene in pNZ8148 (J. E. T. vanHylckama Vlieg, J. A. Wouters, R. van Kranenburg, M. Twigt, J. Muller-Beenhakkers,T. Jansen-van den Bosch, G. Rutten, G. Smit, and P. G. Gruinenberg,unpublished data). The EST2 gene was amplified by PCR with oligonucleotidesest5 (5-GATATACCCATGGCGCTCGATCCCGTCATTCAG-3) and est3(5-CGTGAGTGCCTGCAGTCGCTTGCATCCGCCTTTTG-3) using HighFidelity DNA polymerase. The pT7-SCII-AG vector (32) was used as the template.The amplification primer est5 was designed to introduce an NcoI restrictionsite (underlined) upstream of the initiation site, whereas est3 was designedto introduce a PstI restriction site (underlined) downstream of the stop codon ofthe EST2 gene. By insertion of the NcoI restriction site into the EST2 gene, thesecond amino acid was changed from Pro to Ala. This substitution did not alterthe main characteristics of EST2. The PCR product, eluted from an agarose geland digested with NcoI and PstI, was ligated into NcoI-PstI-digested expressionvector pNZ8148 to create the pNZ7408 construct.The cloned fragment was completely sequenced to verify that no undesiredmutations were introduced during amplification. By using this plasmid the EST2gene was expressed under direct control of the nisin-inducible promoter (7).L. lactis NZ9000 cells containing pNZ7408 were cultured in 50 ml of M17medium supplemented with 0.5% glucose and chloramphenicol (10 g ml1).Cells were induced at an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.5 with 1, 2, 5,and 10 ng/ml of nisin, and uninduced cells were used as a control.Cells were harvested after 90 min of induction by centrifugation (5,000  g,4°C, 10 min) and were resuspended in 5 ml of 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer(pH 7.5).Cells were disrupted with a French pressure cell (Aminco Co.), and debris wasremoved by centrifugation. The crude extracts obtained were used in spectrophotometricesterase assays and Western blot analyses.Electrophoreses and Western blot analysis. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamidegel electrophoresis (12.5%) was performed with a Bio-Rad Mini-ProteanII cell unit as described by Laemmli (25). By using a transblot apparatus (Bio-Rad), proteins were electrotransferred (1 h at 100 V) onto a polyvinylidenedifluoride (PVDF) immunoblot membrane (0.2 m; Bio-Rad) in 0.375 M Trisglycinebuffer (pH 8.3) containing 10% methanol. Subsequently, the PVDF sheetwas removed, soaked in blocking buffer (1 phosphate-buffered saline, 5% milk,0.05% Tween 20) and incubated for 1 h with an anti-EST2 rabbit antiserum (30)diluted 1:1,000 in blocking buffer. The membrane was washed twice in blockingbuffer (15 min each) and incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-linkedwhole antibody from goat diluted 1:3,000 in blocking buffer. The filter waswashed again as described above and developed with 3,3-diaminobenzidine andhydrogen peroxide.Esterase activity. The initial rates of p-nitrophenoxide release from pNPhexanoatewere determined by measuring the absorbance at 410 nm in 1-cmpath-length cells with a Cary 100 spectrophotometer (Varian, Australia). Theinitial rates were calculated by linear least-squares analysis of time coursescomprising less than 10% of the total substrate turnover. Assays were performedat 30°C in mixture containing 40 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), 4%acetonitrile, and 100 MpNP-hexanoate. A stock solution of pNP-hexanoate wasprepared by dissolving the substrate in pure acetonitrile. Assays were carried outin duplicate or triplicate, and the results were expressed as the means of twoindependent experiments.One unit of enzymatic activity was defined as the amount of protein thatreleased 1 mol of p-nitrophenoxide/min from pNP-hexanoate (at the temperaturesused) (30). The absorption coefficient used for p-nitrophenoxide was14,000 M1 cm1.Determination of the pH optimum for esterase activity. The dependence ofthe initial velocity on pH was monitored at 348 nm (the pH-independent isosbesticpoint of p-nitrophenol and the p-nitrophenoxide ion) with a molar absorptioncoefficient of 5,000 M1 cm1 at 30°C. The following buffers were used: 50mM sodium citrate in the pH range from 4.0 to 5.5, 50 mM sodium phosphate inthe pH range from 5.5 to 7.0, and 50 mM Tris-HCl in the pH range from 7.0 to8.0. Data were analyzed as described by Dixon and Webb (9).Determination of esterase activity at different NaCl concentrations. The dependenceof the initial velocity on the NaCl concentration was monitored at 410nm. Assays were performed at 30°C by using mixtures containing 40 mM sodiumphosphate buffer (pH 7.5), 4% acetonitrile, 100 M pNP-hexanoate, and differentamounts of NaCl (0 to 10%, wt/vol). Assays were carried out in duplicate ortriplicate, and the results were expressed as the means of two independentexperiments. The absorption coefficients used for activity calculations were determinedat each NaCl concentration used and ranged from 14,000 to 16,000M1 cm1.Thioesterase activity as determined by the DTNB assay. Enzyme activity withthioesters was analyzed by the DTNB assay (44). The initial rates of formation offree thiol groups from S-methyl thiobutanoate were determined by measuringthe absorbance at 410 nm of 5-thio(2-nitrobenzoic acid) in 1-cm-path-length cellswith a Cary 100 spectrophotometer (Varian, Australia). The initial rates werecalculated by linear least-square analysis of time courses comprising less than10% of the total substrate turnover. The standard assay mixture contained 50mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), 2 mM DTNB, 20 mM S-methyl thiobutanoate,and 1 ng/ml of enzyme. A stock solution of S-methyl thiobutanoate wasprepared by dissolving the substrate in dimethyl sulfoxide. One unit of enzymaticactivity was defined as the amount of protein that released 1 mol of 5-thio(2-nitrobenzoic acid) per min from DTNB. Assays were carried out in duplicate ortriplicate, and the results were expressed as the means of two independentexperiments. The absorption coefficient used for DTNB was 13,700 M1 cm1.Determination of the pH optimum for thioesterase activity. The dependenceof the initial velocity on pH was monitored at 410 nm, and the assay wasperformed as described above for the esterase activity assay by using 2 mMDTNB and 20 mM S-methyl thiobutanoate as the substrate. The absorptioncoefficient for DTNB was calculated for each pH value.Determination of thioesterase activity at different NaCl concentrations. Thedependence of the initial velocity on the NaCl concentration was monitored at410 nm, and the assay was performed as described above for the esterase activityassay by using 2 mM DTNB and 20 mM S-methyl thiobutanoate as the substrate.The absorption coefficient used for the assay was determined at each NaClconcentration, and the values ranged from 13,700 to 14,100 M1 cm1.Esterase and thioesterase activities in milk. Ester degradation and thioesterdegradation were determined in highly pasteurized (HP) milk (full-fat milkheated at 102°C for 30 min and stored at 4°C until it was used) by using purifiedEST2 (3 ng/ml) and EstA (3 ng/ml). Ethyl-hexanoate and S-methyl thiobutanoatewere added at concentrations of 5 mg/liter and 150 g/liter, respectively.The samples were incubated for 16 h at 30°C, and at different times 3 ml of eachsample was removed and boiled for 10 min to quench the reaction. Ester andthioester and their degradation products were analyzed by headspace gas chromatography(HS-GC), as described previously (1), by using flame photometricdetection for the thioester and flame ionization detection for the ester. Theanalysis was standardized with exact quantities of ester and thioester in the HPmilk matrix.Esterase and thioesterase activities in cheese paste. Ester degradation andthioester degradation by EST2 were monitored in a cheese model (Ch-easymodel) (42). L. lactis NZ9000 or L. lactis NZ9000 containing pNZ7408 wasincubated in cheese paste for 2 weeks at 17°C in the presence of ethyl-hexanoate(5 mg/kg) or S-methyl thiobutanoate (150 g/kg). The control did not containadded any lactic acid bacteria. After incubation, samples were analyzed byHS-GC to determine the extent of (thio)ester degradation.In vitro ester synthesis assays. Different parameters, such as pH, salt concentration,and the presence of sugars or protein, and combinations of these parameterswere evaluated. The assays were carried out in buffered solutionswithout organic solvents. The enzyme was used at a concentration of 10 ng/ml.The reaction buffer contained 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 5.5 or 7.5),50 M p-nitrophenol, and 500 M hexanoic acid. In some cases the buffercontained 5% NaCl, 4% lactose, or 20 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA) (see Table 3), and several combinations of these compounds were tested in the assays.Ester synthesis was measured spectrophotometrically by monitoring the decreasein absorbance at 410 nm (Cary 100; Varian). All the assays were performed at20°C. The initial rate was calculated by linear least-squares analysis of timecourses comprising less than 20% of the total substrate turnover. Assays wereperformed in duplicate or triplicate, and the results were expressed as the meansof two independent experiments. The absorption coefficients were determinedfor each different condition used. One unit of synthetic activity was defined as theamount of protein that synthesized 1 mol of pNP-hexanoate/min.Ester synthesis in cheese paste. An analysis of ester synthesis in cheese pastewas performed in order to confirm the ester synthesis in a cheese paste model(42). We added 1.5 ml of 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 5.5) containingethanol (final concentration in the paste, 20 mg/kg), hexanoic acid (final concentrationsin the paste, 200 mg/kg), 1% (wt/wt) NaCl, and the enzyme (8 ng) to25 g of cheese paste. The same mixture without enzyme was used as a control.The samples were incubated for 24 h at 17°C. After incubation, the samples wereanalyzed by HS-GC with flame ionization detection to determine the amount ofethyl-hexanoate formed. Exact amounts of ethyl-hexanoate in the cheese pastematrix were used to standardize the analysis.
