The amount of butyl butyrate
formed was determined using gas chromatography (Focus GC with
AS3000 autosampler, Interscience, Breda, Netherlands). The system
was calibrated using butyl butyrate. The gas chromatograph was
equipped with a Flame ionisation Detector and a Restek Rxi-5 ms
column with dimensions of 30 m  0.25 mm  0.25 lm. The carrier
gas was helium and the make-up gas was nitrogen. Conditions:
injection volume was 1 lL; oven temperature was 50 C for
2 min and was then raised to 300 C at a rate of 20 C/minute
and stayed at 300 C for 2 min; software was Chrom-Card v2.4.1
Purifications have also been performed using flash chromatography
which fractionates the material using the same column
material in a larger column and a linear gradient of water and
methanol (details about methods are available in supporting information
2). Similar results were obtained and are therefore not
shown.
