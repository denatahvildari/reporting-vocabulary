2.4.2. Total fatty acid concentration and composition
The total fatty acid concentration and composition were determined
by a sequence of mechanical cell disruption, solvent based
lipid extraction, transesterification of fatty acids to fatty acid
methyl esters (FAMEs), and quantification of FAMEs using gas
chromatography (GC-FID) as described by Lamers et al. (2010)
and Santos et al. (2012) with modifications as described by Breuer
et al. (2012).
