 The radius of
gyration of the polydisperse sample considered here, was
determined by size exclusion chromatography and found to be
ranging from 20 to 80 nm. On the other hand b -lactoglobulin
is a milk protein with a globular shape (Morr & Ha, 1993 ;
Renard, 1994 ). Depending on the pH and the salt concentration
it can exist as a monomer, dimer or octamer (Renard,
1994 ; Schaink & Smit, 2000 ; van Dijk & Smit, 2000 ). The
hydrodynamic radius of b -lactoglobulin depends on the pH
and is of the order of 2???3nm (Renard, 1994 ). Thus the typical
size of a dextran coil is considerably larger than the protein.
