Samples of 0.25 mL were taken and added to
a measuring flask containing hydrochloric acid
(pH . 1) to inactivate the enzyme. After 1 min,
an equimolar amount of sodium hydroxide was
added to neutralise and the measuring flask
was filled with distilled water. 5 mL-samples
were taken and filtered through a 0.45-mm
disposable filter (Schleicher & Schuell, Dassel,
Germany). The filtered sample was diluted
approximately 200 times, and 0.75 mL sample
was taken and analysed by HPLC. The concentrations
were calculated using calibration
curves; more information on the analysis
method can be found in [14].
