The crude cell extract was centrifuged at 9047
????g at 4 ???C for 10 min. catA2 was purified from the crude extract by .KTA
fast protein liquid chromatography (GE health care, USA) using a
5 mL NI-NTA column (Qiagen, The Netherlands). The proteins were
eluted with 20 mM Tris???HCl (pH 8) with a 0???500 mM imidazol gradient
at a flow rate of 5 mL/min for 20 min. The purification of catA2
was monitored with SDS-PAGE and Westernblotting using His-Tag
antibodies (Abcam, U.K.)
