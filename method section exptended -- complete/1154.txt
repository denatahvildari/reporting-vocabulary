2.5. Determination of monomers, oligomer and polymer fractions
For determining what fraction of the a-lactalbumin monomers
was incorporated into protein oligomers and protein polymers, size
exclusion chromatography (SEC) was performed on 100 mL aliquots
taken from the reaction mixture at various reaction times. The aliquots
were injected on a Bio-Silect SEC 400-5300 mm  7.8 mm
column, connected to a Biologic DuoFlow Chromatography system.
Elution was done using 0.1 M NH4Ac (pH 6.8), detection at 280 nm.
Prior to injection, the column was equilibrated with the elution
buffer. For determining (weight) fractions of monomers, oligomer
and protein polymers, chromatograms were divided into three regions.
The non (intermolecularly) cross-linked a-lactalbumin
monomers eluted from 11 mL to 12.2 mL. The exclusion limit of the
Bio-Silect SEC 400-5 columnwas reported to be around 106 g/mol
for globular proteins, and for the purpose of the present determination,
any cross-linked protein products eluting in the void (that
is, at elution volumes smaller than 7.5 mL) were classified as
???protein polymer??? whereas cross-linked protein products at intermediate
elution volumes (from 7.5 mL to 12.2 mL) were classified as
???protein oligomers???. For all aliquots, the estimated error in the total
area under chromatograms was about 5%. The fraction of each
species was taken to be the ratio of the area in the chromatogram
for that particular species, divided by the total area for the three
species combined. The whole experiment has been carried out in
duplicate, with very similar results. The duplicate experiment was
performed by using a Superose 6 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare,
Uppsala, Sweden) connected to an Akta Purifier system at room
temperature. Samples were eluted with 0.1 M NH4Ac buffer pH 6.8
at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min, detection was done at 280 nm.
2.6. Determination of size-mass scaling exponent
For determining the relation between the size and molar mass
of the species present in the final cross-linked reaction product, the
latter was separated into chromatographic fractions on a Sephacryl S-500HR (GE Healthcare) column (exclusion limit is between
4  104 and 2  107 kDa for Dextran standards), connected to an
AKTA purifier system (GE Healthcare). A volume of 100 mL of final
reaction product was injected onto the column, and eluted with
0.1MNH4Ac (pH 6.8), at room temperature, at a flowrate of 0.8 mL/
min. Prior to injection, the column was equilibrated with elution
buffer. Detection was done using at 280 nm and 318 nm. Fractions
of 0.5 mL were collected for elution volumes from 8 mL to 18 mL.
For the light scattering analysis, the fractions were concentrated
about 10 times using Amicon Ultra centrifugal filters (Cat No.
UFC8000396). The protein concentration of the concentrated
fractions was determined spectroscopically at 280 nm (see sample
preparation). Static and dynamic light scattering experiments were
done on each of the concentrated fractions using a Malvern
Nanosizer ZS (Malvern) equipped with an Argon ion laser emitting
vertically polarized light with a wavelength of 633 nm. The scattering
angle was 12.8. Hydrodynamic radii RH reported are the
major peak from the peak analysis as performed by the Malvern
DTS software, version 6.20. Weight-averaged molar masses Mw
were determined from the static light scattering intensities using
the Rayleigh expression

where C is the weight concentration. The weight concentration C of
cross-linked protein was determined using spectrophotometry,
using the same molar extinction coefficient for protein polymers as
that of the a-lactalbumin monomer. This is reasonable since crosslinking
hardly affects the absorption at 280 nm (we have found
changes of max. 5%) (see Supplementary data). The constant KR is
the Rayleigh constant and Rq is the Rayleigh ratio at the scattering
angle of 12.8. The constant KR is given by:
