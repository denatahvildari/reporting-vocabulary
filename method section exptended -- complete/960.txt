 The molecular conformation of CMC was determined
at pH 6.7 and 3.0 by using size-exclusion chromatography
combined with multiple-angle laser-light-scattering
(SEC???MALLS). CMC was dissolved in 0.08M NaNO3 , to
which phosphate buffer was added. the pH was adjusted to
6.7 or 3.0 and a total ionic strength was 0.1 M. Measurements
yielded distributions of molecular mass,Mw  and radius of gyration,
rg . In addition, rg  is plotted against Mw  on a double
logarithmic scale. The slope ??  of this line is a measure of the
conformation of the molecule. Weight averages of Mw  and
rg , the overlap concentration, c??? , and ??  are given in Table 1
 for pH 6.7 and 3.0. At pH 3.0, which is near the pK  of CMC,
larger values of Mw  and rg  were obtained indicating slight
aggregation of the polysaccharide, probably due to the lower
charge density. The overlap concentration is only slightly
affected by this aggregation and ??  is approximately 0.3, indicating
a compact spherical conformation and a slight degree
of branching [18] .
