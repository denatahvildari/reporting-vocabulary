 Gel permeation chromatography (GPC)
Oligomers were analyzed in a Viscotek GPCmax VE
2001 system fi tted with a Viscotek internal pump
and a Viscotek TDA 302 triple detector array for
refraction index and viscosity detection. An external
Waters Lambda max UV detector at 230 nm was
also used. The data were recorded on an Omnisec
4.5 station. The products were separated with MZGel
SD  Plus series columns of 50 ?? , 100 ?? , 1000 ??
and 10,000 ?? operating at 40 o C. Samples of 150 ?? L
were eluted with chloroform at 1 mL.min 1 . The
average molecular weight was calibrated using a
standard mixture of polystyrene.
 HPLC analysis
The samples were analyzed by HPLC to determine
the unreacted substrates using a Waters 717 Plus
 auto-sampler, Waters 1525 binary HPLC pump and
a Waters 2414 refraction index detector. Samples
and standards in toluene/ tert  -butanol were dried
under reduced pressure (1000 mbar) at 40 o  C. The
solid was dissolved in Milli-Q water: tert- butanol
(4:1). 20 ??  l of fi nal solution were eluted in an ionic
exchange column Alltech OA-100 (sulfonated polystyrene-
divinylbenzene) with 3 mM aqueous sulfuric acid.
The same procedure was used for the standard curve.
 Chromatographic analysis (HPLC ??? MS)
HPLC analysis was carried out using a Waters 2690
equipment provided with a pump, degasser, autosampler,
column oven, diode-array detector, and coupled
to an MS system,fi tted with an electrospray
probe. The analyses were performed with a 250  3
mm ODS-2 Intersil (Varian Inc.) column at 40 o C.
The elution phase A consisted of acetonitrile (Merck)
and the elution phase B was ultra-pure water. Both
mobile phases were supplemented with 0.1% (v/v)
trifl uoroacetic acid (TFA). Gradient elution was
held for 5 minutes at 5% (v/v) A then ramping up
to 95% (v/v) A. The fl ow rate was 1.0 mL.min 1
and the injection volume was 10 ?? L. 0.2 mL.min 1
of the outlet fl ow were pumped into an atmospheric
pressure chemical ionisation mass spectrometer
(APCI-MS) (LCQ, Thermo Finnigan, San Jose,
USA). Quantitative analysis was based on integration
of the peak areas in the chromatogram assuming
that the response factors for all products observed
was one.
