EXPERIMENTALFeedstock MaterialsWheat bran special grant 3607-1687 was supplied byMeneba (Wormerveer, The Netherlands, October 12, 2002).Grass was obtained from the nature reserveWeerribben in theNetherlands (October/November 2002). Both materials weredried and milled with a Culatti mill (1 mm).Characterization and Fractionationof Feedstock MaterialsTo remove starch, first the feedstock material (100 g) wassuspended in maleate-buffer (900 mL; 0.01 M maleic acid,0.01 M sodium chloride, 0.001 M calcium chloride, 0.05%(w/v) sodiumazide, adjusted to pH6.5 with alkali) and stirredfor 1.5 h at 858C. The suspension was cooled to 308C andporcine alpha-amylase (Merck, Whitehouse Station, NJ;150 U/g feedstock) was added to degrade most of the starch ofthe feedstock material (20 h; 308C). Residues were collectedand the alpha-amylase treatment was repeated. Finally,residues were collected, washed with distilled water (658C)and freeze-dried resulting in so-called water unextractablesolids (WUS).WUS (45 g) was suspended in 900 mL of 4 M potassiumhydroxide (KOH)/0.26 M NaBH4, for 16 h at 258C undercontinuous stirring. After centrifugation (10,000g; 30 min)and filtering (G3 glass-filter), the residues were reextractedwith 4 M KOH (þ0.26 M NaBH4). The final residues wereneutralized with acetic acid, dialyzed against distilled waterand freeze-dried (KOHres). The corresponding supernatantswere collected, neutralized, dialyzed, and freeze-dried(KOHss).Enzymatic Degradation of the Wheat Bran andGrass Fractions (WUS, KOHss, and KOHres)A solution of substrate (13 mg WUS, KOHss or KOHres in25 mM sodium acetate buffer pH 5 (1 mL) was incubatedwith commercial enzymes (0.1% w/w enzym/substrate) for24 h at 408C. Enzymes were dialyzed against 25mMsodiumacetate buffer pH 5 at 48C by using Amicon Bioseparationscentrifugal devices (regenerated cellulose; 10,000 MWCO;Millipore, Billerica, MA). Tubes were changed within 45min to prevent degradation of the regenerated cellulosemembranes. The commercial enzymes tested and theirsuppliers are presented in Table I. After inactivation of theenzyme (5 min, 1008C), the digests were analyzed byHPAEC and HPSEC (see below).Enzyme Evaluation EssaysThese assays are performed according to the InternationalUnion of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC).To define filter paper units (FPU) of each of the commercialenzyme preparations (Table I) filter paper (type 1; Whatman, Middlesex, UK) was incubated with an enzymesample in a 0.05Mcitrate-buffer ofpH 5 at 508Cfor 1 h. Afterinactivation (5 min, 1008C) and centrifugation the reducingability was measured according to the Nelson–Somogyiassay (Somogyi, 1952).To define the cellobiase activity (U/mL), a similar experimentwas performed by using the same citrate buffer at508C. However, cellobiose was used as a substrate and theincubation time was 30 min. After inactivation (5 min,1008C) and centrifugation, the amount of glucose formed wasmeasured according to the K-gluc assay kit (Megazyme,Wicklow, Ireland).To define the xylanase-activity (U/mL), the Xylazyme AXtest kit (Megazyme) was used. One tablet of Xylazyme AXwas incubated at pH 5 (0.05 M citrate buffer) and 508C for10 min. The reaction was stopped by addition of a 2%Na3PO4 (pH 11) solution. After centrifugation the amount ofthe chromogenic compound released was measured (590 nm)and related to the amount of reducing end groups formed.Protein ContentThe protein content was determined for all commercialcellulase preparations in triplicate using two widely acceptedmethods: the Bradford reagent assay (Sigma, St. Louis,MO;Bradford, 1976) and the BCA protein assay (Pierce kit:Pierce, Rockford, IL).Neutral Sugar CompositionThe neutral sugar composition was determined by gas chromatographyaccording to Englyst and Cummings (1984),using inositol as an internal standard. The samples weretreated with 72% w/w H2SO4 (1 h, 308C) followed byhydrolysis with 1 M H2SO4 for 3 h at 1008C and theconstituent sugars released were analyzed as their alditolacetates.Uronic Acid ContentThe uronic acid content was determined as uronic acid (UA)by an automated m-hydroxydiphenyl assay (Blumenkrantzand Asboe-Hansen, 1973; Thibault, 1979) using an autoanalyzer(Skalar AnalyticalBV: Skalar,Breda, The Netherlands).Acetic Acid ContentThe degree of acetylation was determined on a ThermoSeparation Products system HPLC, using an Aminex HPXcolumn (Voragen et al., 1986). Detection was performed byuing a Shodex RI-71 detector. The level of acetyl substitutionwas corrected for the free acetic acid in the sample.Starch ContentStarch was determined enzymatically using the test kitsupplied by Boehringer (Ingelheim, Germany).Capillary Electrophoresis (CE)The commercial enzyme preparations were studied by usingcapillary electrophoresis (CE). CE experiments were performedusing a MDQ (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA)equipped with a diode array detector (UV/VIS; 280 nm and200 nm), and according to Jorgensen et al. (2003).Separations were carried out in a fused silica capillary of75 mm ID and 60 cm total length (detection 10 cm fromcapillary end) at 208C using 15 kV. The separation buffer (pH 7.25) was 50 mMpotassium phosphate plus 10mM 1,2-diaminopropane (Jorgensen et al., 2003). Enzyme preparationswere dialyzed against distilled water and filtered (0.22-m low-protein-binding filter). Samples were injected at apressure of 0.5 psi for 5 s. The capillary was rinsed with 0.1MNaOH, water, and buffer between each run. The cellobiohydrolasesI (CBH I) analyzed was purified in our laboratoryfrom Trichoderma viride (Beldman et al., 1985), previouslynamed exoglucanase III.HPSECHigh-performance size-exclusion chromatography was performedon a Thermo Separation Products HPLC systemequipped with a membrane solvent-degasser, three TSKgelcolumns (7.8 mm ID30 cm per column) in series(G4000, G3000, G2500; Tosohaas, Stuttgart, Germany), incombination with a PWX-guard column (Tosohaas). Elutiontook place at 308C with 0.2Msodium nitrate at 0.8 mL/min.The eluate was monitored using a refractive index (RI)detector (Shodex RI-71). Calibration was performed usingpullulans (Polymer Labs, Shropshire, UK).HPAEC (pH 12)High-performance anion-exchange was performed on aThermo Separation Products system equipped with a Dionex(Sunnyvale, CA) CarboPac PA-1 column (4 mm ID250mm) in combination with a Dionex CarboPac PA guardcolumn (3 mm25 mm) and PAD detection (Dionex) (Lee,1996). For the analysis of arabinose, xylose, and glucose inthe hydrolysates, an isocratic elution (1 mL/min) of 20 minwas carried out with a solution of 16mMNaOH. After 20 mina gradient of 0–550 mM sodium acetate in 100 mM NaOHduring 25 min was applied to elute oligomers. Each elutionwas followed by a washing and equilibration step.
