 SEC-MALLS Size exclusion chromatography (SEC)
was performed using Tosohaas PWXL columns (Biogel
TSK 30, 40 and 60 XL ). The gel permeation separation
was carried out at room temperature with 0.2 mol/l
NaNO3 as the eluent. The eluent from the column was
analysed on-line by RI (refractive index) detection, by
UV transmission at a wavelength of 280 nm and by
static light scattering. Static light scattering was performed
with a Wyatt Technology DAWN EOS apparatus.
