\f0\fs20 \cf0  Analytical methods\
The treatment of samples and analysis of monosaccharides,\
organic acids, alcohols and polyols were performed by\
High-Pressure Liquid Chromatography as described earlier\
[\cf2 14\cf0  ]. The cell dry weight determination was performed by\
\pard\pardeftab720

\f1 \cf0 W
\f0  ltration of fermentation broth over a pre-weighed 
\f1 W
\f0  lter\
and drying overnight [\cf2 14\cf0  ]. The ammonium concentration in\
fermentation samples was analysed with an Ammonium\
Test (Spectroquant, Merck, Germany). The chiral purity\
(%) of lactic acid was determined by derivatisation of all\
lactates using methanol, after which both enantiomers of\
methyl lactate were separated on a chiral Gas Chromatography\
column and detected using a Flame Ionisation\
Detector. The chiral purity was expressed as the area of\
the main enantiomer divided by the sum of areas of both\
enantiomers.}
