EXPERIMENTAL
Materials
The roots of Glycyrrhiza glabra, collected in Afghanistan, were
provided by Frutarom US (North Bergen, NJ, USA).
Glabridin and glycyrrhizinic acid were purchased from
Wako Chemicals GmbH (Neuss, Germany). UHPLC/MS
grade acetonitrile (ACN) was purchased from Biosolve BV
(Valkenswaard, The Netherlands). Water was prepared
using a Milli-Q water purification system (Millipore, Billerica,
MA, USA). All other chemicals were purchased from
Merck (Darmstadt, Germany).
Sample preparation
The roots were milled with a model ZM 200 Retsch Ultra
centrifugal mill (Haan, Germany) to yield a root powder with
a particle size of 1mm. The root powder (0.01 g powdered
root/mLsolvent) was extracted with either 70% (v/v) aq.
ethanol (EtOH), EtOH or ethyl acetate (EA). The compounds
were extracted by a two-step sequential extraction with each
solvent for 30 min in a sonication bath at 308C. The extracts
were centrifuged at 2500 g for 15 min. The dried extracts were
obtained after evaporation (EtOH and EA) or after
subsequent lyophilisation (70% (v/v) aq. EtOH). The extracts were resolubilised in methanol (MeOH) and stored at 208C.
All samples were thawed and centrifuged before analysis.
RP-UHPLC analysis
Samples were analysed on a Thermo Accela UHPLC system
(San Jose, CA, USA) equiped with pump, autosampler and
photo-diode array (PDA) detector. Samples (1 mL) were
injected on a Waters Acquity UPLC BEH C18 column
(2.1150 mm, 1.7mm particle size) with a Waters Acquity
UPLC BEH C18 Vanguard pre-column (2.15 mm, 1.7mm
particle size; Waters, Milford, MA, USA). Water acidified
with 0.1% (v/v) acetic acid (eluent A) and acetonitrile (ACN)
acidified with 0.1% (v/v) acetic acid (eluent B) were used as
eluents. The flow rate was 300mL/min, and the PDA detector
was set to measure in the range of 205–400 nm. The following
elution profile was used: 0–18 min, linear gradient from 10%–
100% (v/v) B; 18–22 min, isocratic on 100% B; 22–23 min,
linear gradient from 100%–10% B; 23–25 min, isocratic on
10% B.
Electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry
(ESI-MS)
Mass spectrometric data were obtained by analysing samples
on a Thermo Scientific LTQ-XL (San Jose, CA, USA)
equipped with an ESI probe coupled to the reversed-phase
(RP)-UHPLC system. Of the flow from the RP-UHPLC
system, 150 mL/min was directed to the mass spectrometer.
Helium was used as sheath gas and nitrogen as auxiliary gas.
Data were collected over an m/z-range of 150–1500. Datadependent
MSn analysis was performed with a normalised
collision energy of 35%. The MS3 fragmentation was always
performed on the most intense product ion in the MS2 spectrum. Most settings were optimised using ‘tune plus’
(Xcalibur 2.07, Thermo Scientific) via automatic tuning.
The system was tuned with glabridin in both PI and NI
mode. In the NI mode, the ion transfer tube temperature was
3508C and the source voltage 4.5 kV. In the PI mode, the ion
transfer tube temperature was 3508C and the source voltage
5.0 kV. Data acquisition and reprocessing were performed
with Xcalibur 2.07 (Thermo Scientific).
Mass spectral data interpretation and peak determination
were performed with Mass Frontier 4.0 (Highchem, Bratislava,
Slovakia).
