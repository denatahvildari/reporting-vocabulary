2. Materials and methods
2.1. Materials
Arabinose, xylose and p-nitrophenyl--l-arabinofuranoside were purchased
from Sigma–Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Linear xylose oligomers were from
Megazyme (Bray, Ireland). Standards including single and double substituted xylose
oligomers were available from previous work [14,19].
The endo-1,4--xylanase from Aspergillus awamori was previously purified and
characterized by Kormelink et al. [20].
AXHd3 from B. adolescentis [21] was purchased from Megazyme (Bray, Ireland).
Medium-viscosity water-soluble wheat arabinoxylan (WAX) was obtained from
Megazyme (Bray, Ireland). Alcohol insoluble solids (AIS) and alkali soluble solids
of wheat bran and corn were prepared as described [22]. Characteristics of the
arabinoxylan substrates are shown in Table 1.
2.2. Cloning of arabinofuranosidases encoding genes
The ascomycetous fungus Chrysosporium lucknowsense C1 (accession number:
VKM F-3500D of the All-Russian Collection of Microorganisms of the Russian
Academyof Sciences)wasused for the production of hemicellulases. The fullgenome
of C1 has been sequenced and revealed many genes encoding for cellulases, hemicellulases
and accessory enzymes [23]. Annotated genes, encoding for the putative
arabinofuranosidases Abn7 and Abf3, have been cloned into a specially designed
C1-expression host that allows production of relatively pure enzyme in lab scale
fermentation [24]. The amino acid sequences have been deposited at GenBank with
the accession numbers HQ324255 (Abn7) and HQ324254 (Abf3). The strains were
grown aerobically in 2 L fermentors in mineral medium, containing glucose as carbon
source, ammonium sulfate as nitrogen source and trace amounts of essential
salts [24]. Growth is performed under glucose limitation at pH 6.0 and 32 ◦C. After
fermentation, the supernatants containing the enzymes were tested on WAX for
activity. Both Afb3 and Abn7 showed activity towards WAX releasing arabinose.
2.3. Enzyme purification
For a detailed characterization, the enzymes were further purified. Abf3 and
Abn7 (EC 3.2.1.55) were purified by using anion exchange chromatography on a
Akta purifier system equipped with a SP Sepharose fast flow column (GE Healthcare,
Uppsala, Sweden). The eluate was monitored at 280 and 214 nm. Proteins were
dialyzed against 20mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5. The column was equilibrated
using the same buffer, and the proteins applied onto the column were eluted
using a linear gradient of 0–0.5MNaCl within a 20mMsodium phosphate buffer, pH
6.5. Fractions were collected and tested for enzymatic activity on WAX. The active
fractions were pooled and applied onto a Superdex 200 gel filtration column (GE
Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden), previously equilibrated with 20mM sodium phosphate
buffer pH 6.5. Fractions were collected and characterized using SDS–PAGE
and tested for WAX degrading activity. The active fractions were pooled and stored
in small aliquots at −20 ◦C.
2.4. Preparation of single and double substituted arabinoxylan oligosaccharides
2.4.1. Single and double substituted arabinoxylan oligosaccharides AXOSS+D
Single and double substituted arabinoxylan oligosaccharides (AXOSS+D) were
prepared by incubation of WAX (10 mg/mL) in 50mM sodium acetate buffer,
pH 5, with an endo-(1,4)--xylanase (GH 10) from A. awamori for 24 h at 35 ◦C
(0.07U enzyme per mg substrate). The reaction was stopped by heating the samples
at 100 ◦C for 10 min. The samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000°øg
at room temperature. The supernatant (=AXOSS+D) was used for further experiments.
Degradation of the wheat arabinoxylan into oligosaccharides was followed
by High Performance Anion Exchange Chromatography (HPAEC). Substituted xylooligosaccharides
were identified using standards as prepared previously [14,19].
2.5. Single substituted arabinoxylan oligosaccharides AXOSS
Single substituted arabinoxylan oligosaccharides (AXOSS) were prepared by
incubation of AXOSS+D with arabinofuranosidase AXHd3 from B. adolescentis (0.2U
enzyme/mg of substrate) in 50mM sodium acetate buffer pH 5.0 for 24 h at 35 ◦C
[17]. The reaction was stopped by heating the samples at 100 ◦C for 10 min. The samples
were centrifuged for 5min at 10,000°øg at room temperature. The supernatant
(=AXOSS) was used for further experiments.
2.6. Double substituted arabinoxylan oligosaccharides AXOSD
Double substituted arabinoxylan oligosaccharides (AXOSD) were prepared by
incubation of AXOSS+D with arabinofuranosidase Abf3 (1g enzyme per mg of substrate)
in 50mM sodium acetate buffer pH 5.0 for 24 h at 35 ◦C. The reaction was
stopped by heating the samples at 100 ◦C for 10 min. The samples were centrifuged
for 5min at 10,000°øg at room temperature. The supernatant (=AXOSD) was used
for further experiments.
2.7. pH and temperature optimum
The pH optimum of the arabinofuranosidases was determined at 35 ◦C and
within the range from 3.0 to 8.0 using aMcIlvaine buffer (made from a 0.01Mcitric
acid and a 0.02Mphosphate solution). All experiments were performed in duplicate.
At the pH optimum, the temperature optimum was determined within the range
from 30 to 90 ◦C. Arabinofuranosidases Abf3 and Abn7 (1g enzyme per mg of substrate)
were separately incubated with AXOSS+D. The reaction was stopped after
30 min and the release and quantification of arabinose was followed by HPAEC. The
activity was expressed as unit per mg of protein (1 unit has been defined as 1mol
arabinose released per minute under the conditions specified).
2.8. Activity towards p-nitrophenyl-˛-l-arabinofuranoside
The activity towards p-nitrophenyl--l-arabinofuranoside (pNP-ara) was performed
at 35 ◦C after 30 min of incubation. The reaction mixture consisted of 0.1mL
5mM pNP-ara solution and 0.1mL of the suitable enzyme concentration (2.5g
enzyme per mg of substrate 0.25% (w/w) Abn7 or Abf3 based on protein content)
in 50mM sodium acetate buffer pH 5.0. The reaction was stopped by adding 0.1mL
of 0.25M NaCO3. The color formation was measured at 405 nm. One unit of activity
has been defined as 1mol of p-nitrophenol released per min under the conditions
specified. The molar extinction coefficient under these assay conditions was
13,700 L/M cm.
2.9. Mode of action of arabinofuranosidases
Abf3 and Abn7 mode of actions were determined towards AXOSS+D, AXOSD
and AXOSS (1g enzyme per mg of substrate) at 40 ◦C and pH 5.0. Reactions
were stopped by heating the samples at 100 ◦C for 10 min. The samples were centrifuged
for 5min at 10,000°øg. The release of arabinose and of (un)substituted
xylo-oligosaccharides was monitored by HPAEC.
2.10. Sequential enzyme hydrolysis
The following enzymatic treatments were evaluated: (1) Abn7, (2) Abn7 and
Abf3, (3) endo-1,4--xylanase (A. awamori; GH10) and Abf3 followed by an addition
of Abn7 and (4) endo-1,4--xylanase, Abf3 and Abn7 simultaneously. All enzymes
were individually added in the ratio of 1g enzyme per mg of substrate. The reactions
were taking place at pH 5.0 and 40 ◦C for 24 h. The reactions were stopped by
boiling the samples for 10 min at 100 ◦C and the samples were subsequently centrifuged
at 10,000°øg. The hydrolysis of WAX, of alkali soluble arabinoxylans from
wheat bran (KOHss), of wheat bran AIS, and of corn AIS by the various enzymes
was monitored HPAEC and the released levels of arabinose, xylose, xyland
xylotriose were quantified.  2.11. High Performance Anion Exchange Chromatography
The analysis of the samples was analyzed by HPAEC according to Albrecht et al.
[25] using a CarboPac PA1 (250mm°ø2.1mmID) column (Dionex, Sunnyvale, USA).
A flow rate of 0.3 mL/min was used with the following gradient of sodium acetate in
100mM NaOH: 0–50 min, 0–500mM. Each elution was followed by a washing step
of 5min 1000mM sodium acetate in 100mM NaOH and a re-equilibration step of
15 min 100mM NaOH.
2.12. High Performance Size Exclusion Chromatography (HPSEC)
HPSEC was performed according to Verhoef et al. [26] using three TosoH
Biosep-TSK-Gel G columns in series (4000PWXL-415 3000PWXL-2500PWXL, each
300mm°ø7.5mm; TosoH, Japan). Sample (50L) was injected and eluted at 30 ◦C
using 0.8 mL/min 0.2M NaNO3. Detection was performed using a Shodex RI 71
refractive index detector (Showa Denko K.K., Japan).
