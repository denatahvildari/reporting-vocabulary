METHODSIsolation of Slimy Strains From PaperMachine Slime SamplesSlime samples were collected from submerged and unsubmergedwet end surfaces of three Finnish, two Spanish papermills, and three French paper mills. Of the slime samples 10 gwas homogenized with 90 mL of sterile 0.9% NaCl solution.Spread plate cultures were made of the dilutions 10-2-10-6 onagar plates (Medium I) containing (g/L): glucose (20 g), yeastextract (0.5 g), (NH4)2SO4 (0.6 g), KH2PO4 (3.18 g),K2HPO4 (5.2 g), MgSO47H2O (0.3 g), CaCl2 (0.05 g),ZnSO47H2O (0.2 mg), CuSO45H2O (0.2 mg),MnSO4H2O (0.2 mg), CoCl2 (0.2 mg), FeSO47H2O(0.6 mg), agar (20 g). The plates were incubated inverted at308C and at 508C. Slimy colonies, appearing as large, shinyand viscous when touched, were picked from the plates andtwice purified on same agar medium. Isolated BacteriaThe slimy bacteria isolated were characterized by ribotypingusing the automated RiboPrinter1 Microbial CharacterizationSystem (QualiconTM, Wilmington, DE) following themanufacturer’s instructions with EcoRI or PVUII as restrictionenzymes. The current commercial Id database of DuPontand the own RiboPrint1-database of VTT Biotechnologywere used to identify the genetic fingerprints obtained. Theisolates not identified by these databases were subjected tofurther identification by 16S rDNA sequencing, physiologicaltests and FAME (fatty acid analysis) (Suihko andStackebrandt, 2003). The strains were deposited in culturecollection of VTT or CTP.Production of PolysaccharidesThe isolates were cultivated in shake flasks in liquid mediumwith the same composition as the agar medium used forisolation, containing as nitrogen source (NH4)2SO4 (0.6 g/L)(Medium I). Some isolates were found to produce more polysaccharide on media with alternative nitrogen sourcesBacto tryptone (Difco) (5 g/L) (Medium III) or Bactotryptone (Difco) (1 g/L) (Medium IV), which were subsequentlyused. (There are no polysaccharides produced onmedium II in Table I).In Table I the medium conditions for each individualmicroorganism is given. Protein concentrations of the freezedriedpolysaccharides were measured according to Lowryet al. (1951). Isolation of Polysaccharides0.9% NaCl was added to the culture medium, the mediumwas lightly homogenized for 30–45 s and centrifuged chilledat 14,700g for 45 min to separate the cells. Three volumes ofice-cold ethanol (95%) were added to the supernatant. If theprecipitate did not form at once, the suspension was let tosettle at 88C overnight. The precipitate was either collectedwith a spoon and a strainer or it was centrifuged chilled at3,900g for 15 min. The precipitate was solubilized in a smallvolume of distilled water, dialyzed using Medicell Visking(MWCO 12–14,000 Da) dialyze tube and freeze dried. Insome cases the solubilized polysaccharide after ethanolprecipitation was treated with protease (Neutrase 1.5 L,Novozymes) (100 mL/100 mL, 378C, 1 h) and re-precipitatedwith ethanol as described.Molecular Weight Distribution and Fractionationby High Performance Size ExclusionChromatography (HPSEC)The EPS (2 mg) was dissolved in 1 mL of distilled water andanalyzed by HPSEC performed on a ThermoQuest HPLCusing three TosoHaas TSK-Gel columns in series (4000-,3000-, 2500-, PWXL) preceded by an TSK guard column(406 mm). The sample (20 mL) was injected and eluted at308C using 0.8 mL/min 0.2M NaNO3. Detection wasperformed using a Shodex RI 71 refractive index detector.For fractionation 100 mL sample of 6 mg/mL was injectedon the same system and eluted the same way. Fractions of240 mL were collected in 96-well plates using a GilsonFC203B fraction collector. The fractions were pooled accordingto the carbohydrate populations different in molecularweight and freeze-dried before subjecting them to sugarcomposition analysis.Sugar CompositionThe EPS sugar composition was determined using methanolysisas described by De Ruiter et al. (1992). Therefore, theEPS was treated with 2N HCl in anhydrous methanol for 16 hat 808C, followed by 1 h of 2N CF3CO2H (TFA) hydrolysisat 1218C. The released sugars were analyzed using highperformance anion exchange chromatography (HPAEC)with pulsed amperometric detection (PAD) using a Dionexsystem containing a ThermoQuest HPLC system and aDionex EDM Helium degas unit. After hydrolysis thesamples were injected on a Carbopac PA10 column(4250 mm) with a Carbopac PA10 guard column (450 mm) preceded with a borate trap (Dionex) and separated at1 mL/min by isocratic elution with water for 40 min followedby a linear gradient from 0 to 800 mM NaOH in 30 min.Detection was performed after the post column additionof 0.5mL/min of 1M NaOH using a Dionex ED 40 PADdetector.Determination of the Pyruvateand O-Acetyl ContentThe amount of pyruvate was determined according toTroyano et al. (1996). The EPSs (1 mg) were dissolved in1 mL of 1N TFA and hydrolyzed for 6 h at 1208C. Thehydrolysate was centrifuged and analyzed at 408C using aThermo Quest HPLC system equipped with both a ShodexRI71 refractive index detector and a Thermo SeparationProducts Spectra System UV2000 UV detector at 220 nm.HPLC separation was performed using a Bio-Rad AminexHPX-87H column using 0.01N H2SO4 (0.6 mL/min) as amobile fase. The amount of pyruvate is calculated using acalibration curve of 0.2–2 mM sodium pyruvate.The acetyl content was determined after saponificationwith 0.4M NaOH in 50%(v/v) isopropanol/water accordingto Voragen et al. (1986).FT-IRFor FT-IR measurements 100 mL of the EPS (1 mg/mL) wasdried on anATRcrystal and the absorption spectrumbetween750 and 4,000/cm was measured by co-adding 100 scans andsubtracting both the background and atmospheric water.Spectra were recorded using attenuated total reflectance(ATR) on a Bio-Rad FTS 6000 FT-IR spectrometer.
