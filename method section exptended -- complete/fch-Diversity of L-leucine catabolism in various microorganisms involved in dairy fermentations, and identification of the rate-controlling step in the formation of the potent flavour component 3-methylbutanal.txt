Materials and methods
Microorganisms
All microorganisms were obtained from the NIZO culture collection.
The strains used and their growth conditions are summarised in
Table 1. Strains were grown in 1 l M17-medium (Difco, Detroit,
Mich.) with extra carbon source as indicated. Aerobic cultures were
grown in 250 ml portions in 0.5 l Erlenmeyer flasks in a rotary
shaker, shaking at 200 rpm. The other cultures were grown in closed
flasks without headspace (HS; low oxygen).
Flavour production by microorganisms
Several samples were taken from cultures up to 72 h of incubation,
and the OD600 was measured. A 3 ml aliquot of the sample was
transferred to a 10 ml HS vial, incubated for 0.5 h at growth
temperature, and subsequently stored at −25°C for HS analysis (see
below).
Aliquots (50 ml) of cultures in stationary phase were harvested by
centrifugation (15 min, 5,000 g, 15°C). Pelleted cells were washed
in 25 mM sodium citrate buffer (pH 5.5) and centrifuged again.
Finally, the cells were resuspended in this buffer to a final OD600
between 15 and 25. Aliquots (1 ml) of these cell suspensions were
incubated with two different substrates for 8 h at 30°C in a closed
10 ml HS vial with a total volume of 3.0 ml. The final
concentrations in the first set of incubations were 100 mM sodium
citrate buffer (pH 5.5), 20 mM leucine, 10 mM α-ketoglutaric acid
and 0.25% glucose. The final concentrations in the second set of
incubations were 100 mM sodium citrate buffer (pH 5.5), 5 mM α-
ketoisocaproic acid and 0.25% glucose. After these incubations,
samples were stored at −25°C for HS analysis (see below).
Preparation of cell-free extract
All steps were performed between 0 and 4°C. Cells were grown as
described above, and were washed three times in 25 mM sodium
phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). Washed cells were resuspended to an
OD600 of about 100 in the same buffer and disrupted in a French
press twice at 20,000 psi cell pressure (SLM-instruments, Rochester,
N.Y.). The resulting suspension was centrifuged (30 min, 31,000 g,
4°C) and the supernatants obtained were used for the enzyme assays
described below.
Transaminase activity
Conversion of leucine to α-ketoisocaproic acid was assayed by
incubation of different quantities of cell-free extract (CFE) with
leucine for 2 h at 30°C. The reaction mixture (300 μl) contained
25 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.5), 0.5 mM EDTA, 100 μM
pyridoxal-5-phosphate, 20 mM leucine and 10 mM α-ketoglutaric
acid. After incubation, the reaction was stopped by lowering the pH
to between 2 and 3 with 40 μl 0.50 N HCl. The samples were then
frozen at −20°C. Before analysis, the samples were thawed and
centrifuged in an Eppendorf centrifuge at maximum speed for
15 min. Leucine and α-ketoisocaproic acid concentrations in 50 μl
supernatant were determined by C18 reverse phase high performance
liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) as described below. Because of
the non-linearity of the assay, each assay consisted of a series of
diluted CFE for each strain. Only results with α-ketoisocaproic acid
concentrations ranging from 100 to 500 μM were taken into
account. The assay was performed three times on different days with
different solutions and dilutions to obtain statistically justified
results. The specific activity was expressed as micromoles of α-
ketoisocaproic acid formed per milligram protein in 1 min.
Decarboxylase activity
Conversion of α-ketoisocaproic acid to 3-methylbutanal was
assayed by incubation of CFE in a reaction mixture with a total
volume of 3.0 ml in a closed 10 ml HS vial at 30°C for 3 h. The
reaction mixture contained 50 mM sodium citrate (pH 6.3), 100 μM
thiamin pyrophosphate, 500 μM MgCl2 and 20 mM α-ketoisocaproic
acid. After incubation, the reaction was stopped by lowering
the pH to between 2 and 3 with 70 μl 6.0 N HCl. The amount of 3-
methylbutanal was determined by static HS gas chromatography
(GC) (see description below). The specific activity was expressed as
micromoles of 3-methylbutanal formed per milligram protein in
1 min. As with the transaminase assay, several independent
experiments were performed, with a range of diluted CFE samples.
Hydroxyacid dehydrogenase activity
Conversion of α-ketoisocaproic acid to α-hydroxyisocaproic acid
was assayed by incubation of different quantities of CFE in a
reaction mixture with a total volume of 300 μl in a 300 μl 96-well
plate at 30°C for 30 min, measuring the OD340 every 30 s. The
reaction mixture contained 50 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.0),
1.1 mM NADH and 10 mM α-ketoisocaproic acid. The specific
activity was calculated from the change in OD with time, corrected
for the change in the blank without substrate. The specific activity
was expressed as micromoles of NADH consumed per milligram
protein in 1 min. Again, a minimum of three independent
experiments was performed, with a range of diluted CFE samples.
Incubation of Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris B1157 CFE
Two series of incubation mixtures were prepared in 10 ml HS vials.
The 5 ml reaction mixture in each vial contained 50 mM sodium
citrate (pH 6.0), 100 μM thiamin pyrophosphate, 500 μM MgCl2,
2 mMα-ketoisocaproic acid and 25 or 500 μl CFE of B1157. Series
2 also contained 2.0 mM NADH. The reaction was started by adding
the substrate to the vial followed by tightly closing it with a septum
and cap. At several time points the incubations were stopped by
lowering the pH to between 2 and 3 with 100 μl 6.0 N HCl. After
cooling the vial from 30°C to 4°C, 2 ml reaction mixture was
withdrawn from the vial and frozen at −20°C for C18 RP-HPLC
analysis as described below. The HS vials were also frozen at −20°C
until static HS GC (see below) was performed. Production of 
components is expressed per milligram of protein.
Protein determination
Protein content of CFE, needed for calculation of the specific
activities, was determined by the BCA protein assay reagent kit
from Pierce (Rockford, Ill.). A 30 μl sample was mixed with 240 μl
“work reagent” from the kit. After incubation at 37°C for 20 min the Reversed phase high performance liquid chromatographyDetermination of leucine, α-ketoisocaproic acid, α-hydroxyisocaproicacid and isovaleric acid was performed on an HPLC systemconsisting of two M6000A peristaltic pumps (Waters, Milford,Mass.), a type 680 gradient controller (Waters), a Spectro flow 783UV detector at 220 nm (Kratos, Ramsey, N.J.) and a wide pore C184.6×250 mm RP column preceded by a C18 guard column (Bio-Rad,Richmond, Calif.). The column was equilibrated with 2% acetonitrile,0.1% trifluor acetic acid (TFA) in water before applying 50 μlsample. Components were eluted at 30°C at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min using a 20 min gradient from 2% to 12% acetonitrile +0.1%TFA. The column was washed after each run by a 5 min gradientfrom 12 to 60% acetonitrile +0.1% TFA. Concentrations werecalculated by using calibration samples containing α-ketoisocaproicacid and leucine in water ranging from 100 to 500 μM.Headspace gas chromatographyThe equilibrium HS concentration of 3-methylbutanal and 3-methylbutanol was analysed by GC. A 1.0 ml HS sample wasinjected splitless on the column after 20 min of incubation at 60°C.The sample was concentrated on a Fisons MFA815 cold trap (CEInstruments, Milan, Italy) with the following settings: 300 s splitlesstime; 91 s waiting before heating the cold trap; −150°C initialtemperature and final temperature at injection 200°C. The separationwas performed on a GC-8000 top gas chromatograph (CEInstruments), equipped with a CP-SIL 5 CB low-bleed column(30 m ×0.25 mm, film thickness 1.0 μm, Chrompack, Middelburg,The Netherlands) and a flame ionisation detector. The oventemperature was initially 40°C for 5 min, then it was increased by15°C/min to 150°C and kept at 150°C for 5 min. Inlet and detectortemperatures were 250°C and 270°C, respectively. Carrier flow was1.8 ml/min helium. Calibration was performed by measuring severaldilutions of a 3-methylbutanal and 3-methylbutanol mix in water atconcentrations ranging from 5 to 500 μM.
