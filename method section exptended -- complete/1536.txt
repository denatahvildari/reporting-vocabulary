 Protein sequencing. The preparation of protein for Nterminal
sequencing was completed before the optimized
purification strategy described above was developed and
involved Q-Sepharose chromatography, dialysis into
1M .NH4.2SO4, centrifugation, chromatography on
butyl???Sepharose, dialysis into 2 M .NH4.2SO4 + standard
Hepes buffer, chromatography on a 1 ml Resource
Ether linkage column from Pharmacia, and preparative
2% agarose gel electrophoresis. The gel was then sectioned
and one half was immersed in 300 lM 2,3-DHBP
in 25mM Hepes, pH 8.0. The yellow band indicating
meta-cleavage activity was marked with a razor blade
and stained with Coomassie brilliant blue.
 Identification of metabolic intermediates. Carbazole,
anthranilic acid, and catechol were identified by coelution
with authenticated standards on reverse-phase
high-performance liquid chromatography [26] with a
variable wavelength UV detector (Waters model 440).
One ml culture samples were quenched by the addition
of an equal volume of acetonitrile, vortexed for 1 min,
and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for a minimum of 3 min.
The column was a Zorbax C-18 0:75  2:5cm held at
60 C in a Waters column oven. The running buffers
were 0.1% (v/v) phosphoric acid and acetonitrile at a
flow rate of 1 ml/min and a sample volume of 15 ll. The
separation gradient was from 15 to 75% acetonitrile over
7.5 min, followed by a wash of 95% acetonitrile for
2 min.
