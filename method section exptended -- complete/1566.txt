Fractionation of polyol dehydrogenases was performed by anionexchange
chromatography. A cell extract was prepared as described
above using either 20 mM Tris pH 7?5 or 20 mM Bistris pH 6?5 as a
buffer, in both cases containing 1 mMMgCl2, 5 mM2-mercaptoethanol
and 0?5 mMEDTA. Four millilitres of desalted cell extract was applied
to a ResourceQ column (Amersham Biosciences) and, following
rinsing with extraction buffer, protein bound to the column was eluted
with a linear gradient of 0???0?5 M NaCl in extraction buffer. Polyol
dehydrogenase activities were measured in the fractions obtained.
