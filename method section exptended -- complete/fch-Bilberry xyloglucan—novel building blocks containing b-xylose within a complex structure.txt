 5. Experimental
5.1. Material
Bilberries (V. myrtillus L.) were obtained from Kiantama
Ltd, Suomussalmi, Finland. Alcohol insoluble
solids (AIS) were prepared from homogenised berries.
In three extraction steps (hot buffer, chelating agent,
50 mM sodium hydroxide), the pectic polysaccharides
were extracted from AIS. The hemicelluloses were
extracted from the residual cellulose with 6 M sodium
hydroxide (concentrated alkali soluble solids; CASS)
as described previously.15
 5.2. Fractionation of hemicelluloses with anion exchange
chromatography
About 250 mg CASS was dissolved in water and the
solution was centrifuged (10,000g). The supernatant  was applied on a DEAE Sepharose Fast Flow column
(100 ·  2.6 cm, GE Healthcare, Chalfont St. Giles, United
Kingdom) and the unbound material was eluted
with 530 mL of 5 mM sodium acetate at pH 5.0 (CASS
unbound).18
5.3. Degradation of xyloglucan with xyloglucan specific
endo-glucanase (XEG)
 Xyloglucan containing material (5 mg) was dissolved in
1 mL of 50 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) and
incubated with 1 l L xyloglucan specific endo -glucanase
(XEG, EC 3.2.1.151 from Aspergillus aculeatus ,
2259 U/mL)16  overnight. AIS (5 mg/mL) were incubated
with additional 5 l L polygalacturonase (EC
3.2.1.15 from Kluyveromyces fragilis , 16 U/mL)27  and
1 l L pectin methyl esterase (EC 3.1.1.11 from Aspergillus
niger , 180 U/mL)28  for pectin degradation.2
5.4. Sugar composition as alditol acetates
 For determining the sugar composition, samples were
pre-hydrolysed using 72% w/w sulfuric acid at 30  C
for 1 h and subsequently hydrolyzed with 1 M
H2 SO4  at 100  C for 3 h.29  Afterwards the sugars
were derivatised to their alditol acetates and determined
by gas chromatography30  using inositol as
internal standard.
5.5. Uronic acid content
 The total uronic acid content was determined photometrically
with the automated m -hydroxydiphenyl assay.31
5.6. HPAEC of xyloglucan oligomers
 Xyloglucan oligosaccharides were analysed on a Carbo-
Pac PA 100 column (4 ·  250 mm, Dionex, Sunnyvale,
USA) and on a CarboPac PA 1 column (2 ·  250 mm,
Dionex, Sunnyvale, USA) with pulse amperometric
detection (PAD) using a column specific sodium
hydroxide–sodium acetate-gradient as described previously
32  and a flow of 1 mL/min for the 4 ·  250 mm
column and of 0.3 mL/min for the 2 ·  250 mm column,
respectively.
For desalting a FC-203B fraction collector (Gilson,
Middleton, USA) was connected that collected fractions
of 30 s directly after the PAD. These fractions were collected
in a Sep-Pak tC18 (40 mg) 96-well plate (Waters,
Milford, USA) containing 0.5 mL of 0.5 M acetic acid
per well. The eluent was sucked through the Sep-Pak
tC18 (40 mg) 96-well plate by vacuum with a Multi-
Screen resist vacuum manifold (Millipore, Billerica,
USA). After washing two times with 1 mL water, the
oligomers were eluted with 2 mL methanol and the fractions
were dried at 60  C.17
 Preparative HPAEC was performed on a preparative
CarboPac PA 100 column (22 ·  250 mm, Dionex, Sunnyvale,
USA). The same gradient as on analytical scale
was applied with a flow of 18 mL/min. Fractions were
collected every 30 s.
5.7. MALDI-TOFMS
 Matrix assisted laser desorption ionisation time of flight
mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOFMS) was performed
using an Ultraflex workstation (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen,
Germany) equipped with a nitrogen laser of 337
nm and operated in a positive mode. After a delayed
extraction time of 200 ns, the ions were accelerated to
a kinetic energy of 12,000 V and detected using reflector
mode. The lowest laser power required to obtain good
spectra was used and at least 100 spectra were collected.
The mass spectrometer was calibrated with a mixture of
maltodextrins (mass range 350–2350).
The xyloglucan oligomers were desalted using Sep-
Pak tC18 (20 mg) cartridges (Waters, Milford, USA).17
 The sample solution (2 l L) was mixed on the MALDI-
TOF-plate (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany)
with 2 l L matrix solution of 9 mg/mL 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic
acid (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) in
30% acetonitrile and dried under a stream of air.33
5.8. ESIMSn
 Electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (ESIMS) was
performed on a LTQ Ion-trap (Thermo Electron,  San
Jose, USA). The sample was applied through a PicoTip
emitter capillary (4 l m ID of the tip, New Objective,
Woburn, USA). MS analysis was carried out in the positive
mode using a spray voltage of 1.5 kV and a capillary
temperature of 200  C. The instrument was autotuned
on xyloglucan oligosaccharides. MS2  and higher
were performed using a window of 1 m /z  and a relative
collision energy of 30%.17
5.9. CE-LIFD
 For capillary electrophoresis (CE), xyloglucan oligosaccharides
were labelled with 8-aminopyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonate
(APTS) using the ProteomeLab Protein
Characterisation kit (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton,
USA).
The labelled oligosaccharides were separated on a
polyvinyl alcohol (N CHO) coated capillary (50 l m
ID ·  50.2 cm, detector after 40 cm, Beckman Coulter,
Fullerton, USA) using a ProteomeLab PA 800 characterisation
system (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, USA)
and a laser induced fluorescence detector (LIFD) at an
excitation wavelength of 488 nm and an emission wavelength
of 520 nm (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, USA).
The separation was carried out in reversed polarity at  30 kV in a 25 mM acetate buffer containing 0.4% polyethylene
oxide at pH 4.75. The capillary was kept at
25  C.17
5.10. CE-ESIMSn
 For identification of the different oligomers, separation
was carried out on a P/ACE MDQ capillary electrophoresis
system (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, USA) with a
fused silica capillary (50 l m ID·  80 cm) connected to a
UV-detector (after 20 cm) and an ESIMS detector (LTQ
Ion-trap, Thermo Electron, San Jose, USA) by a device
made in our laboratory. The separation was carried out
in reversed polarity at 28 kV in a 50 mM ammonium
acetate buffer containing 0.2% formic acid at pH 2.8.
The capillary was kept at 15  C. For ESIMS, a sheet
flow of 4 l L/min of 75% isopropanol in water was used.
ESIMS was operated in the negative mode using a spray
voltage of 2.2 kV and a capillary temperature of 190  C.
The instrument was auto-tuned on xyloglucan oligosaccharides.
MS2  and higher was performed using a window
of 1 m /z  and a relative collision energy of 30%.17
5.11. 1H NMR spectroscopy
 Prior to NMR analyses, the samples were reduced with
sodium borohydrate,23  desalted using Sep-Pak tC18
(20 mg) cartridges (Waters, Milford, USA) and the reduced
xyloglucan oligomers were dissolved in 99.96%
D2 O (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, USA) and after
freeze-drying dissolved in 99.996% D2 O (Cambridge
Isotope Laboratories, USA). 1 H NMR spectra were recorded
at a probe temperature of 300 K on a AMX-500
spectrometer (Bruker BioSpin, Rheinstetten, Germany)
located at the Wageningen NMR Centre. Chemical
shifts were expressed in ppm relative to internal acetone:
2.225 ppm. The 1D 1 H proton spectra were recorded
with pre saturation of the HOD signal (70 dB) at
500.13 MHz using 256 scans of 8192 data points and a
sweep width of 6000 Hz.
