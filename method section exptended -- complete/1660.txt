Monomeric sugars were measured by High Performance
Anion Exchange Chromatography with Pulsed Amperometric
Detection (HPAEC-PAD). A Dionex system with
Carbopak PA1 column with pre-column was used at
30??C, with de-ionized water as the mobile phase (1 mL/
min) and fucose as the internal standard. The Dionex
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)
method was also used for the determination of monomeric
sugars in the aqueous phase of both pretreated and
enzymatically hydrolyzed wheat straw. Dry matter content
was 91.8% (w/w) (24 h at 105??C). The chemical
composition of the used wheat straw is shown in Table 1.
