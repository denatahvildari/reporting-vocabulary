Preparation of PTAG Derivates???The free amino groups of the
internal peptides were PTAG derivatized in 100 mM KH2PO4 (pH 7.5)
with DL-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (Sigma Aldrich) at a final concentration
of 90 mM and freshly prepared sodium cyanoborohydride
in a final concentration of 30 mM at room temperature. Freshly
prepared sodium cyanoborohydride was added at 1 h and 2 h intervals
and the reaction mixture was further incubated overnight. Following
PTAG derivatization, peptide mixtures were extensively purified
by C18 solid phase extraction (SPE) chromatography (column
dimensions 5 cm (L)  200 m inner diameter (ID), in-house packed
with 5 m Reprosil Pur C18-AQ, Dr Maisch, Ammerbuch-Entringen,
Germany).
