\f0\fs16 \cf0 The amount of butyl butyrate\
formed was determined using gas chromatography (Focus GC with\
AS3000 autosampler, Interscience, Breda, Netherlands). The system\
was calibrated using butyl butyrate. The gas chromatograph was\
equipped with a Flame ionisation Detector and a Restek Rxi-5 ms\
column with dimensions of 30 m  0.25 mm  0.25 
\f1\fs19 l
\f0\fs16 m. The carrier\
gas was helium and the make-up gas was nitrogen. Conditions:\
injection volume was 1 
\f1\fs19 l
\f0\fs16 L; oven temperature was 50 C for\
2 min and was then raised to 300 C at a rate of 20 C/minute\
and stayed at 300 C for 2 min; software was Chrom-Card v2.4.1\
Purifications have also been performed using flash chromatography\
which fractionates the material using the same column\
material in a larger column and a linear gradient of water and\
methanol (details about methods are available in supporting information\
2). Similar results were obtained and are therefore not\
shown.}
