 After addition of an
internal standard (2,3,5,6,3? -pentachlorobiphenyl
(CB112)), the extract was concentrated on a rotary
ev aporator, and the extract was cleaned by gel permeation
chromatography (GPC) ov er Polymer Laboratories
(PL) gel column (600/ 25 mm, pore size 10 m m), using
dichloromethane at 10 ml/min. The fraction between 17
and 23 min, representativ e for compounds with molecular
mass lower than m/z 1000 and free of triglycerids,
was collected. The fraction was concentrated under
nitrogen to approximately 200 m l. The final analysis
was carried out with GC/MS, using electron capture
negativ e ionisation (ECNI) as ionisation technique with
 methane as a reagent gas. A 50 mCP Sil 8 column (i.d.
0.25 mm, film thickness 0.25 m m) under full scan
conditions (m/z 34/ 800) was utilised. In addition, an
electron impact (EI) full scan screening (m/z 34/ 800)
was performed. The peak identification was based on a
comparison of MS-spectra from the NIST98 library and
using the deconv olution peak identification programme
AMDIS.
The ECNI technique was used for its sensitiv ity for
bromine. A selectiv e ion monitoring chromatogram of
bromine (m/z 79) is shown in Fig. 1 B for C. intestinalis  .
All these peaks contained also the bromine isotope m/z
81(results not shown) except one (indicated in Fig. 1 B).
