After heat inactivation of the enzyme and freeze-drying the reaction
mixture, the HA products were separated using flash column
chromatography with Silica Gel 60 as column material and n-butanol/
water/acetic acid (3:1:1) as eluent [17]. The tubes containing
the same compound were pooled and dried with a rotavap. As a final
step, the purified HA oligosaccharides were identified using
HPLC and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-offlight
(MALDI-TOF). The prepared stock of HA4 still contained minor
traces of HA2.
The derivatized HA-fluor products were purified in three separation
steps on an .KTA explorer fast protein liquid chromatography
(FPLC) system monitoring the eluents at 215 and 340 nm: (i)
desalting the derivatized oligosaccharides with a Sephadex G10
column and 50 mM ammonium acetate as eluent, (ii) separating
the fluorescent saccharides from the unreacted ones using a Source
30Q column with an NaCl gradient from 0 to 0.5 M over 100 min at
a flow rate of 2 ml/min, and finally (iii) removing the NaCl through
desalting with a Sephadex G10 column and 50 mM ammonium
acetate. Samples containing the same compound were pooled
and freeze-dried after each separation step. After the last separation
step, the products were identified with MALDI-TOF.
