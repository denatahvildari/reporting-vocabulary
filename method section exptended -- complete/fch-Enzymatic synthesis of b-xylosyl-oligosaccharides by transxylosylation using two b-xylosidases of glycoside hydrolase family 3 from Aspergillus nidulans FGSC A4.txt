xylitol, sorbitol, maltose, sucrose, lactose, cellobiose, turanose,
lactulose, isomaltose, trehalose, palatinose, melibiose, sophorose
and gentibiose were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis,
MO). D-Xylose was from Carl Roth (Karlsruhe, Germany). D-Glucose
was from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Xylobiose, xylotriose,
xylotetraose, xylopentaose and xylohexaose were purchased from
Megazyme (Wicklow, Ireland).  3.2. Cloning of bxlA and bxlB encoding GH3 b-xylosidases
P. pastoris X-33 (FGSC database accession no. 10077 and
10125; www.fgsc.net) harbouring A. nidulans FGSC A4 full-length
bxlA (GenBank ID: EAA64470.1) and bxlB (GenBank ID:
EAA67023.1)30 were purchased from Fungal Genetics Stock Center,
School of Biological Sciences, University of Missouri, (Kansas
City, MO). The two genes were recloned to encode mature polypeptides
lacking Met1–Ser18 (BxlA) and Met1–Ser23 (BxlB)
(http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/).41 Expand High Fidelity
DNA polymerase (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany)
was used for DNA amplification with oligonucleotide primers
(Supplementary Table S1) based on the genomic sequence.42 A silent
mutation (1374T?C) in the bxlB EcoRI site was introduced by
overlap PCR43 using appropriate primers (Supplementary Table
S2). PCR products were digested for bxlA by XhoI and XbaI and
for bxlB by EcoRI and NotI (New England BioLabs, Ipswich, MA)
and cloned in frame with the a-mating factor secretion signal
in pPICZaA (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The plasmids were transformed
into Escherichia coli DH5a (Invitrogen) and selected on
low salt Luria Bertani medium supplemented with 25 lg/mL Zeocin.
Fully sequenced plasmids (Eurofins MWG Operon, Ebersberg,
Germany) were linearised by PmeI (New England BioLabs), transformed
into P. pastoris X-33 (Invitrogen) by electroporation
(Micropulser; Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc, Hercules, CA) and selected
at 30 C for 3 days on yeast peptone dextrose plates (1% yeast extract,
2% peptone, 2% dextrose) containing 1 M sorbitol and
100 lg/mL Zeocin. 3.3. Production and purification of BxlA and BxlB
P. pastoris transformants were grown in 3 L (BxlA) or 4 L (BxlB)
buffered glycerol-complex medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone,
100 mM potassium phosphate pH 6.0, 1.34% yeast nitrogen base
with ammonium sulfate, 4  105% biotin, and 1% glycerol) at
30 C for 24 h to OD600 of 25 (BxlA) and 52 (BxlB). Cells were harvested
(3000g, 5 min, 4 C) and resuspended for induction in 1 L
buffered minimal methanol medium (BxlA; 100 mM potassium
phosphate pH 6.0, 1.34% yeast nitrogen base with ammonium sulfate,
4  105% biotin, 1% methanol, 1% casamino acid) or in 1 L of
buffered methanol-complex medium (BxlB; 0.5% methanol, 1%
yeast extract, 2% peptone, 100 mM potassium phosphate pH 6.0,
1.34% yeast nitrogen base with ammonium sulfate, 4  105% biotin)
at 22 C for 72 (BxlA) and 120 h (BxlB). Methanol was supplemented
every 24 h to a final concentration (v/v) of 1% (BxlA) and
0.5% (BxlB), until harvest (13,500g, 4 C, 1 h).
The BxlA culture supernatant was concentrated with buffer
exchange to 10 mM MES pH 6.0 (Pellicon tangential flow filtration
systems, nominal molecular weight limit (NMWL) 10 kDa;
Millipore, Billerica, MA) and applied to a 6 mL Resource Q column
(GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) equilibrated in the same buffer.
After wash with 37.5 mM NaCl in the same buffer, protein was
eluted by a linear 37.5–325 mM NaCl gradient (flow rate: 2 mL/
min). Fractions containing BxlA were pooled, concentrated
(Amicon Ultra-15, NMWL 30 kDa, Millipore) and applied to a
Hiload 26/60 Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated
with 20 mM MES, 0.25 M NaCl pH 6.0 (flow rate: 1 mL/min). BxlA-containing fractions were pooled, concentrated and buffer exchanged
to 10 mM MES pH 6.0. The BxlB culture supernatant was
adjusted to pH 7.5 by 1 M K2HPO4, filtered (0.22 lm; TPP, Trasadingen,
Switzerland) and applied to 5 mL HisTrap HP column (GE
Healthcare) equilibrated with 20 mM HEPES, 0.5 M NaCl, 10 mM
imidazole pH 7.5. Following wash with the above buffer containing
22 mM imidazole, BxlB was eluted by a linear 22–400 mM imidazole
gradient (flow rate: 1.0 mL/min). BxlB-containing fractions
were pooled, concentrated (Centriprep YM30, Millipore) and applied
to a Hiload 26/60 Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare)
equilibrated with 20 mM MES, 0.15 M NaCl pH 6.8 (flow rate:
0.5 mL/min). Fractions containing BxlB were pooled, concentrated
and buffer exchanged to 20 mM HEPES pH 7.0. All purification
steps were performed using an ÄKTAexplorer chromatograph (GE
Healthcare) at 4 C.
3.4. Properties of BxlA and BxlB
Protein concentration was determined spectrophotometrically
at 280 nm using E0.1% = 1.79 and 0.97 for BxlA and BxlB, respectively,
determined by aid of amino acid analysis. Molecular masses
were estimated by SDS–PAGE (NuPAGE Novex Bis-Tris gels; Invitrogen)
and gel filtration (precalibrated Hiload 16/60 Superdex 200
column; flow rate: 1 mL/min; Gel Filtration Calibration Kits; GE
Healthcare). Theoretical molecular masses were calculated using
ExPASy–ProtParam tool (http://www.expasy.ch/tools/protparam.
html).44 N-Glycosylation was predicted using NetNGlyc 1.0 Server
(http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetNGlyc/).45 Endoglycosidase H
(New England BioLabs) deglycosylation of BxlA (7 lg) and BxlB
(5 lg) was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Carbohydrate contents were determined on 400 lg enzyme using
the phenol–sulfuric acid method46 with either glucose or mannose as standard. Isoelectric focusing of 600 ng BxlA and 400 ng BxlB
was carried out (Pharmacia PhastSystem; GE Healthcare) at pH
4.0–6.5 (4 cm polyacrylamide PhastGel IEF) using the low range
pI (pH 2.5–6.5) calibration kit and PlusOne Silver Stain Kit, Protein
(GE Healthcare).
3.5. Enzyme activity assays of BxlA and BxlB
pNPX (2 mM) was hydrolysed at 40 C for 10 min by BxlA
(20150 nM; 50 mM sodium acetate pH 5.0) or BxlB (25250
nM; 50 mM sodium acetate pH 5.2) in 50 lL reaction mixtures.
The reaction was stopped by 1 M Na2CO3 (100 lL) and pNP was
quantified spectrophotometrically at 410 nm using 0.050.5 mM
pNP as standard. One unit was defined as the amount of enzyme
liberating 1 lmol of pNP per min under the assay conditions.
pH activity optima of BxlA (71 nM) and BxlB (179 nM) were
determined for the pH range of 2.0–10.0 towards pNPX (2 mM)
in 40 mM Britton–Robinson buffer.47 Activity was determined in
the temperature range of 25–80 C using the above BxlA and BxlB
concentrations in 50 mM sodium acetate pH 5.0 and 5.2, respectively.
The stability at 40 C in the pH range of 2.0–10.0 (40 mM
Britton–Robinson buffer) and at 25–80 C was deduced from residual
activity towards pNPX of 355 nM BxlA and 895 nM BxlB after
5 h incubation.
Initial rates of hydrolysis at 8 concentrations of pNPX (0.1–
8.0 mM), pNPA (0.2–2.0 mM) and b-xylo-oligosaccharides (X2–X6,
0.4–6.0 mM) were measured using 40 nM (for pNPX), 465 nM
(for pNPA), 32 nM (for X2X6) BxlA, and at 11 different concentrations
of pNPX (0.1–8.0 mM), pNPA (0.1–8.0 mM), X2X6
(1.0–8.0 mM) using 66 nM (for pNPX and X2X6) and 328 nM
(for pNPA) BxlB. Hydrolysis of X2–X6 was assayed in 50 mM sodium
acetate pH 5.0 for BxlA and pH 5.2 for BxlB (100 lL reaction mixture) and stopped by addition of 2% p-bromoaniline and 4%
thiourea in glacial acetic acid (500 lL) and incubated in the dark
at 70 C for 10 min, followed by 60 min at 37 C and quantified
from the absorbance at 520 nm using 0.25–5.0 mM xylose as
standard.48,49 Kinetic parameters, Km and kcat, were determined
by fitting the Michaelis–Menten equation to initial rates using
SigmaPlot v. 9.0.1 (Systat Software Inc. San Jose, CA). Due to poor
affinity (Km >8 mM), kcat/Km of pNPA was obtained from the slope
of the plot of initial rate (m/[E]) versus substrate concentration.
3.6. Transxylosylation by BxlA and BxlB
Transxylosylation with (1) 200 nM BxlA, 30 mM pNPX and
200 mM acceptor (D-xylose, D-arabinose, D-lyxose, L-fucose,
L-rhamnose, D-glucose, D-galactose, D-mannose, D-talose, D-fructose,
xylitol, sorbitol, maltose, sucrose, lactose, cellobiose, turanose,
or lactulose) in 50 mM sodium acetate pH 5.0 (1 mL) or (2)
1.7 lM BxlB, 25 mM pNPX and 400 mM acceptor as above except
for sugar alcohols and including also (L-arabinose, L-lyxose, xylobiose,
isomaltose, trehalose, palatinose, melibiose, sophorose, or gentibiose)
in 40 mM sodium acetate pH 5.2 (1 mL) occurred at 40 C
during 5 h. Aliquots (5 lL for BxlA; 10 lL for BxlB) were removed
at time intervals and added to 100 mM NaOH (195 lL for BxlA)
and 500 mM NaOH (90 lL for BxlB). The BxlB samples were diluted
to a suitable concentration level before analysis. Products were
quantified based on peak areas in HPAEC-PAD (ICS-3000 IC system;
Dionex Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA) equipped with CarboPac
PA200 anion exchange column (3  250 mm and 3  50 mm guard
column; Dionex) using a linear 0–75 mM sodium acetate gradient
in 100 mM NaOH (35 min; 25 C; flow rate: 0.35 mL/min) calibrated
with xylobiose and xylotriose for di- and trisaccharide products,
respectively. Transxylosylation yields were calculated based
on the pNPX concentration.
3.7. Xylosyl-oligosaccharide purification
For structural analysis of tranxylosylation products reactions in
50 mM sodium acetate pH 5.0 (1 mL) were performed as described
in Section 3.6 with (1) BxlA and D-xylose, D-arabinose, D-lyxose,
L-fucose, D-glucose, D-mannose, D-talose, sucrose, or turanose and
(2) BxlB and D-xylose, D-glucose, D-galactose, D-mannose, D-talose,
D-fructose, xylobiose, sucrose, lactose, turanose, or lactulose at
40 C for optimal reaction times (Fig. 4). Reactions were terminated
by heat inactivation (95 C, 10 min) followed by centrifugation
(18,000g, 4 C, 5 min), desalting (Amberlite MB-20; Fluka, Sigma
Aldrich), and filtration (0.45 lm nylon filter; Frienette Aps, Kenbel,
Denmark). Oligosaccharides were purified by HPLC (UltiMate 3000
Standard LC system; Dionex) equipped with a TSKgel Amide-80
column (5 lm, 4.6  250 mm and 4.6  10 mm guard column;
TOSOH, Tokyo, Japan) and refractive index detector (RI-101; Showa
Denko, Kanagawa, Japan) at 1 mL/min (for mobile phase composition
and column temperature see Supplementary Table S3). The
purity was assessed by thin layer chromatography (TLC; aluminium-
coated Silica Gel 60 F254, Merck) developed by acetonitrile/
water (80:20, v/v), sprayed with orcinol/sulfuric acid/water/ethanol,
(2:10:10:80, w/v/v/v) or with a-naphthol/sulfuric acid/methanol
(0.03:15:85, w/v/v) and tarred at 120 C.
3.8. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy
Purified oligosaccharide products (500 lL, 12 mM) were vacuum
dried (from BxlA; Savant SVC100 SpeedVac Concentrator; Savant
Instruments, Inc. Farmingdale, NY) or freeze dried (from BxlB;
CoolSafe 55 C; ScanLaf A/S, Lynge, Denmark) and dissolved in
deuterium oxide. Structures were determined by 1H and 13C NMR
analysis. The majority of the spectra was recorded on a Varian
Unity Inova 500 MHz NMR spectrometer and a few on a Bruker
Avance 800 MHz spectrometer. A series of 2D homo- and heteronuclear
correlated DQF-COSY, NOESY, gHSQC, and gHMBC spectra
were obtained using standard pulse sequences. The proton chemical
shifts were referenced to the solvent dH 4.78 ppm and the carbon
shifts were referenced according to C5 of xylose at 66.1 ppm.
3.9. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry
ESI-MS was performed (LTQ XL ion trap MS; Thermo Scientific,
San Jose, CA) on vacuum dried or lyophilised samples (see Section
3.8). Samples were dissolved in milliQ water (100 lg/mL) and
applied to a Thermo Accela UHPLC system equipped with a Hypercarb
(100  2.1 mm, 3 lm) column (Thermo Scientific). Elution
was performed with a gradient of deionized water/acetonitrile
and 0.2% trifluoroacetic acid (0.4 mL/min; 70 C). MS detection
was performed in the positive mode using a spray voltage of
4.5 kV and a capillary temperature of 260 C and auto-tuned on
glucohexaose.50
