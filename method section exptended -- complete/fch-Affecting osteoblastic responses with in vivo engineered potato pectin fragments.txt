MATERIALS AND METHODSIsolation of pectic RG-I material from potatoThree different potato lines of Solanum tuberosum L. cv.Posmo were used; the wild-type (MHRP_WT) and two transgeniclines of this background line MHRPTR_ARA reduced inarabinan26 and MHRPTR_GAL reduced in galactan.27 These sampleswill later be referred to as WT, ARA, and GAL, respectively.The potato plants were grown outside, and when harvested,the tubers were immediately processed and kept at–80C.The frozen potato cubes were crudely homogenized in aBraun kitchen chopper, then added to phenol:acetic acid:water (PAW) (1 kg phenol: 500 mL acetic acid: 500 mLwater/kg cubes) and incubated for 2 h at 4C. The mixturewas filtered through a sieve (38 lm mesh) and the cell wallmaterial that remained in the sieve was washed with tapwater (10 L) to remove all traces of phenol. The cell wallpreparation was added to a sodium deoxy-cholate (SDC)buffer (20 mM Hepes, 5 mM Na2S2O5, 1% SDC, pH 7.5) andfurther homogenized with a Polytron homogenizer at maximumspeed for 2 min. The cell wall material was thensuccessively washed in a sieve (38 lm mesh) with SDCbuffer (0.5%, 2 L), water (5 L), and salt buffer (2 L, 10 mMCH3COOH, 3 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2, pH 5). AnOctagon digital shaker equipped with two sieves (38 and 53lm) was used for washing with water (2 L) followed bywashing through only one sieve (38 lm). The cell wall preparationwas homogenized once more in the salt buffer andfinally drained in the shaker. The resulting cell wall materialwas frozen at 80C.The amounts of the starch removing enzymes were allcalculated according to the weight of starting potato cubes.The cell wall material was added into 70C MES-buffer (10mM MES, 1.8 mM CaCl2, pH 6.5) and heated to 80C. Termamyl(0.4 KNU/g, Novozymes) was added and the mixturewas incubated for 20 min while stirring. The mixture wasfiltered through a sieve (38 lm). The residue in the filterwas transferred to a beaker and salt-buffer (10 mMCH3COOH, 3 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2, pH 5), andPullulanase (0.09 Units/g, Megazyme) were added, and themixture shaken for 1 h at 37C. The pH was then adjustedto 7.5 with KOH. a-Amylase (20 Units/g, Merck) was added,and the mixture shaken for 1.5 h at 37C. Finally, the mixturewas shaken overnight with Pronase (0.16 Units/g, Sigma) at 37C and then sodium azide (Sigma-Aldrich) wasadded (0.1%). The resulting cell wall material was filtered,washed with water, and freeze-dried.The freeze-dried cell wall material was de-esterified withNa2CO3 (0.5M) on ice overnight. An equal amount (50 mM,pH 5.5) of CDTA (Sigma-Aldrich) was then added, and thesample shaken with endopolygalacturonase M2 (80 Units/g,Megazyme) at 37C overnight. The sample was centrifuged(3000 rpm, 10 min) and the supernatant dialyzed (MWCO12,000) against water for 24 h. The retenate was subjectedto another endopolygalacturonase M2 treatment, dialyzedagainst water, and the final retentate was freeze-dried.Chemical characterization of pectinsSugar compositions were determined using methanolysis followedby trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) hydrolysis according toRef. 28. Samples were analyzed on high-performance anionexchangechromatography (HPAEC) system (ISC-3000 System,Dionex) equipped with a CarboPac PA1 analytical columnand a CarboPac PA1 guard column and a pulsed amperometricdetector (Dionex). Linkage analyses were performedaccording to the Hakamori procedure as described in Ref. 28:Only neutral sugars present in the pectins were included inthe analysis as galacturonic acids were not reduced beforemethylation. The levels of methyl esters and acetyl groupswere analyzed by Ultimate 3000 HPLC system (Dionex) afterchemical saponification of the pectins as described in Ref. 23.High-performance size exclusion chromatography was performedusing Dionex Ultimate 3000 system equipped with aseries of three TosoHaas TSK-Gel G columns (4000WXL,3000PWXL, 2500PWXL; Tosho Bioscience) and a Shodex refractiveindex detector (Showa Denko) as described in Ref. 28.Surface modificationSample MHRs were covalently grafted onto TCPS dishes (Ø 3.5cm), a method described in Ref. 9. Briefly, dishes were surfacefunctionalizedusing allylamine plasma deposition [aminated(AMI) surface], after which the carboxyl groups of MHR- (ARA,GAL, WT) molecules were linked to the deposited aminogroups via carbodiimide condensation. AMI samples representingan intermediate phase of the grafting procedure are usedas controls of the successful coating of pectin molecules.Cell culturesThe sample dishes were sterilized at 4C overnight with 10 penicillin-streptomycin solution (Sigma-Aldrich), and thenimmortal (but noncancerous) murine preosteoblasticMC3T3-E1 (subclone IV) cells (ATCC, LGC Promochem)were seeded on the dishes at a density of 104 cells/cm2 inDulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium, a-modification (a-MEM, Gibco). The medium was supplemented with 10% fetalbovine serum (Gibco), 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 lg/mLstreptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich), and 1% L-glutamine (L-Glu,Gibco). For RT-PCR analyses, the cells were induced to differentiatein mineralization culturing medium containing 50lg/mL L-ascorbic acid 2-phosphate (AsAP, Sigma) and 102M b-glycerol phosphate disodium salt pentahydrate (bGP,Fluka). Ascorbic acid is needed for enhanced expression ofosteoblast marker genes as well as for collagen depositionand ALP activity of differentiated osteoblasts, and functionssynergistically with b-glycerol phosphate.29 The cells weregrown in a 37C incubator (5% CO2, 95% air) for 48 h inthe proliferation assay and for 2 weeks (changing the mediumevery third day) in the differentiation assay.Stainings. To visualize the actin cytoskeleton and focal adhesiondots of the fixed cells, fluorescently-labeled tetramethylrhodamineisothiocyanate (TRITC)-phalloidin or fluoresceinisothiocyanate (FITC)-phalloidin and paxillin antibodywere used. The cells were incubated in a dilution of 1:200of TRITC-phalloidin (Sigma Chemical) for 20 min at 37C.For paxillin staining, the cells were permeabilized with0.1% (v/v) Triton-X-100 in PBS for 10 min on ice, afterwhich they were treated with 0.2% bovine serum albumin(Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 min at RT. The staining reaction wasperformed on ice using 1:100 mouse monoclonal paxillinantibody (ZYMED Laboratories) for 45 min and with aTRITC-conjugated or FITC-conjugated secondary antibody(ALEXA Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG, Molecular Probes)for 30 min. TRITC-phalloidin fluoresces red, whereas FITCdenotes as green-fluorescing structures.To detect the mineral produced by differentiating cells,tetracycline—an antibiotic that binds to newly-produced calciumand can be visualized as a fluorescing stain—wasadded in the cultures. Three different tetracycline hydrochloride(Sigma-Aldrich) concentrations (0.167, 0.333, and0.667 ng/lL at culturing day 10 and 1.67, 3.33, and 6.67ng/lL at day 13) were tested.At the end of the culturing, the cells were fixed with a3.0% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) solution for 10 minat room temperature (RT).Microscopy and analysesA confocal microscope (LSM 510, Zeiss) was used to visualizethe stained cells. Tetracycline samples were visualized mainlywith a 63 objective. Focal adhesion parameters—the length(lm), proportional area (%), and number of the FA dots—were quantified from 10 confocal microscopic fields (40 objective) per sample type with a digital image analysis system(MCID-M5þ, Imaging Research, Canada). The resultswere statistically analyzed with a t-test using SPSS14.0 software.The limit of the statistical significance was set at a pvalue = 0.05. Graphs were created with Origin6.0 software.RT-PCRTotal RNA from growing cells was isolated with GenEluteTMMammalian Total RNA Kit (Sigma-Aldrich) according to themanufacturer’s instructions at 7-day and 14-day time points.The concentration and purity of RNAs were analyzed with aspectrophotometer (Eppendorf BioPhotometer).RNAs were used in reverse transcriptase polymerasechain reactions (RT-PCR), in which RNA is reverse-transcribedto cDNA and subsequently amplified with PCR reactionsusing gene-specific primer pairs. RT-PCR reactionswere conducted with the RobusTTM I RT-PCR Kit (Finnzymes)according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The amount of RNA used in the reactions varied from 30 to 230ng/lL depending on the concentrations of the RNA isolates(1.0 lL of the RNA solution was used in each reaction).While repeating RT-PCR reactions, 100 ng RNA/50 lLreaction was used to enhance the comparability and also0.5 lL/50 lL reaction of RNAse inhibitor (RNAguardTMRnase Inhibitor 20,700 U/mL) was used. All the RNA isolateswere tested negative for any DNA contamination induplicate OCN reactions lacking the reverse transcriptase.The kit’s reagents for a positive control were used accordingto the manufacturer’s instructions.The primer sequences (Sigma Proligo) for ALP were 50-GCCCTCTCCAAGACATATA-30 (forward) and 50-CCATGATCACGTCGATATCC-30 (reverse) demarcating a product size of372 bp,30,31 and for OCN 50-CCTCAGTCCCCAGCCCAGATCC-30(forward) and 50-CAGGGCAGAGAGAGAGGACAGG-30 (reverse)demarcating a product size of 219 bp.31 PCR reactions forall the genes started with 30 min at 48 followed by 10 minat 95 (ALP) or at 94 (OCN). Genes were amplified in 30cycles of 1 min 95, 2 min 55, and 1 min 72 (ALP), and30 s 94, 30 s 58 , and 1 min 72 (OCN). Reactions werecompleted with 7 min at 72.The produced DNA fragments were detected with 1%agarose (Sigma) gel electrophoresis by staining the fragmentswith 1 lg/mL SYBRVR Green I Nucleic Acid Stain(Fluka). DNA samples were loaded into the gel with gelloading solution (Sigma) and electrophorised at 80–120 Vfor 45 min–1 h (Stratagene 10  10 Horizontal ElectrophoresisApparatus, Catalog # 400440) in 1  Tris-acetate-EDTA buffer (Sigma-Aldrich). DNA bands are visualized withUV light (Alpha Innotech), and the sizes of the fragmentswere compared to GeneRulerTM 100 bp DNA ladder(Fermentas).O
