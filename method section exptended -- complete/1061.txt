High-Performance Size-Exclusion-Chromatography (HP-SEC):
Nondissociating Conditions. HP-SEC measurements were conducted
using an A?? KTA purifier system (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden)
operated by Unicorn software. The samples (TH, F, R, and -lg) were
kept at pH 2. After centrifugation (18000 g, 10 min, 20 ??C), 100 ??L of
sample was applied onto the column (Shodex protein KW-803, 300 ????
8 mm, Showa Denko K. K., Tokyo, Japan). The column was
equilibrated and run with a HCl solution of pH 2 using a flow rate of
0.3 mL/min. Diluting the fibrils in a HCl solution of pH 2 is not
expected to result in dissociation of the fibrils.3 The absorbance was
monitored at 214 nm. The column was calibrated using various proteins
with molecular masses between 300 and 42000 Da.
To have an indication of the proportion of fibrils that passed the
HP-SEC column, the area below the SEC elution profiles of the total
heated sample and -lactoglobulin (and two dilutions of both samples)
was compared with the amount of protein that was injected onto the
SEC column. There was a linear correlation between the area below
the HP-SEC elution profile and the amount of protein injected onto
the column. -Lactoglobulin and the total heated sample could be
described by the same linear relation and the variance was small (slope
of 0.43 and variance of 0.06 AU?? ml/mg protein). Because unheated
-lactoglobulin did not contain any fibrils, we concluded that almost
all material passed the SEC-column for this sample, implying that
almost all material of the total heated sample also passed the column.
