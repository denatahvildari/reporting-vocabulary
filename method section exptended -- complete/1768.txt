High-performance size exclusion chromatography
analysis The size distribution and the molecular weight of
the heparosan polymers were analyzed by HPSEC on an
Ultimate 3000 (Dionex, Sunnyvale, USA) using three
TosoH Bioscience TSK-gel columns in series (4000, 3000,
and 2500 Super AW, 150??~6.0 mm) preceded by a TSK AWL
guard column (35??~4.6 mm; TosoH Bioscience, Japan) as
previously described (Chavaroche et al. 2011). For each
HPSEC analysis, the molecular weight and the size distribution
of the samples were determined by fitting to a logarithmic
model the elution time of the hyaluronan molecular
mass markers (30, 160, and 262 kDa, Hyalose) (Chavaroche
et al. 2010).
High-performance anion exchange chromatography
analysis The composition of the reaction mixture (UDPFig
sugars and heparosan oligosaccharides) was analyzed by
high-performance anion exchange chromatography
(HPAEC) using an ICS-3000 Ion Chromatography HPLC
system equipped with a CarboPac PA-1 column (2??~
250 mm), in combination with a CarboPac PA guard column
(2??~25 mm), a VWD-3100 single wave detector (Dionex,
Sunnyvale, USA), and a pulsed electrochemical detector in
pulsed amperometric detection mode (Dionex, Sunnyvale,
CA, USA) in series. The same elution conditions as previously
described were used (Chavaroche et al. 2011). The
presence of a peak with UV detection, as with electrochemical
detection, shows the presence of an UDP group
(Orellana and Mohnen 1999).
