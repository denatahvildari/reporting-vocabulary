2. Experimental2.1. Characterization of the acetylated pectins from differentsources2.1.1. SubstratesSugar beet pectin, (SBP6230) with degree of methylesterifica-tion (DM) of 62 and DA of 30 was extracted from sugar beet pulpand this pectin was further de-esterified by alkali or by plant orfungal pectin esterases to yield different series of pectins (Table 1).SBP6230 modified by plant pectin methylesterase (p-PME) yieldedthe P-series of SBP (P5328, P3429) and SBP6230 modified by fungalpectin methylesterase (f-PME) yielded the F-series (F5129, F3331).For the B-series, SBP6230 was alkali de-esterified yielding B5326,B4626, B3124 and B0915. Partial deacetylation of SBP6230 in asodium methylate/methanol solution resulted in B6126, B6109,B6023, B5803. The chemical preparation and composition of theseSBPs have been described elsewhere (Buchholt et al., 2004).Pectic material from sunflower and potato material (DuPont),Okra (Sengkhamparn, Bakx, Verhoef, Schols, Sajjaanantakul, &Voragen, 2009) and apple modified hairy region (MHR) (Schols,Voragen, & Colquhoun, 1994) (Table 1), acetylated xanthan (Kool,Schols, Delahaije, Sworn, Wierenga, & Gruppen, 2013) and acety-lated eucalyptus xylan oligomers (Van Gool, Vancsó, Schols, Toth,Szakacs, & Gruppen, 2011) were also used as substrates for test-ing enzyme specificity. Mild alkali-treated SBP5519 (B5519) andSBP1713 (B1713) was prepared following the procedure for prepa-ration of the B-series of sugar beet pectin (Buchholt et al., 2004).2.1.2. Constituent monosaccharide composition analysisDetermination of the neutral monosaccharide and uronicacid contents of sunflower and potato material was carried outas previously described elsewhere (Remoroza, Cord-Landwehr,Leijdekkers, Moerschbacher, Schols, & Gruppen, 2012).2.1.3. Determination of the DM and DAPectin samples (2 mg/ml) were saponified in 100 mM NaOH andafter neutralization the DM was determined using a colorimetricmethod (Guillotin, Van Loey, Boulenguer, Schols, & Voragen, 2007)while the DA was analyzed using the Megazyme acetic acid kit(Megazyme, Wicklow, Ireland).2.2. Production and purification of BliPAE2.2.1. Bacterial strains, media, and growth conditionsB. licheniformis DSM13 and E. coli strains NEB 5-alpha (NewEngland Biolabs, Frankfurt a. Main, Germany) and Rosetta 2(DE3)(pLysSRARE2) (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium at 37◦C. For plasmid maintenance, E. coli strains were grown in the presence of ampicillin and/or chloram-phenicol at a final concentration (f.c.) of 100  g/ml and 34  g/ml,respectively. After transformation of the latter strain with theBliPAE expression plasmid, 40 mM glucose was added to themedium when the strain was grown on LB agar plates.2.2.2. Cloning of the BliPAE coding sequenceThe cell pellet of 0.5 ml of a B. licheniformis DSM13 overnightculture was resuspended in 50  l 10 mM Tris/HCl buffer (pH8.0) and incubated at 99◦C for 5 min. Next, the suspensionwas centrifuged (13,000 × g, 1 min, room temperature (RT)) andthe supernatant was used as template for the PCR ampli-fication of the BliPAE open reading frame (ORF; GenBankaccession number (acc. no.) AAU42913). For this, Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (Fermentas, St. Leon-Rot, Germany) andprimers 5-CCGCAATTCCATATGATGCGAGACATTCAGTTGTTTTTG-3(forward) and 5-CCCGAGCTCTAAAGGAATTCCCGCTTCTTTTG-3(reverse) were used. Additionally, an NdeI recognition site, overlap-ping with the start codon, and a SacI recognition site, concomitantlyremoving the ORF’s stop codon, were introduced. The ampliconobtained was cut with NdeI/SacI and ligated with the likewise cutand dephosphorylated expression vector pET22b-StrepIIc, being apET-22b(+) (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) derivative additionallycontaining a sequence coding for the StrepII affinity tag. Compe-tent cells of E. coli NEB 5-alpha were transformed with the ligationreaction and plasmids were kit-isolated from the transformantsobtained. Correctness of insertion and coding sequence was ver-ified by determination of the nucleotide sequence of the insertand the flanking regions (Eurofins MWG, Ebersberg, Germany).The BliPAE expression plasmid generated was termed pET22b-BliPAE-StrepIIc. PCR, agarose gel electrophoresis, DNA restrictionendonuclease digestion, ligation and transformation of E. coli weredone as described in Sambrook and Russell (2001).2.2.3. Synthesis and purification of BliPAEE. coli Rosetta 2(DE3) (pLysSRARE2) was transformed withpET22b-BliPAE-StrepIIc and grown in 500 ml auto-inductionmedium (Studier, 2005) complemented with ampicillin and chlor-amphenicol. Incubation was done in a shaking incubator for4 h at 180 rpm and 37◦C and further for 20 h at 120 rpmand 26◦C. Alternatively, for additional induction, isopropyl- -D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG; f.c. 0.5 mM) was added after 15 hof incubation. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (4200 × g,10 min, 4◦C), the pellet was resuspended in 30 ml 40 mM tri-ethanolamine buffer (pH 8.0) containing 0.4 M NaCl and frozen at−20◦C. The thawed suspension was incubated for 30 min at RT, 75 Ubenzonase (Merck) were added and the suspension was sonicated.Centrifugation (40,000 × g, 40 min, 4◦C) yielded the crude extract,and BliPAE was purified via affinity chromatography using a 1-ml Strep-Tactin Superflow Plus Column (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany)according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For enzyme concen-tration and buffer exchange, Vivaspin columns (MWCO 10 kDa;Sartorius, Göttingen, Germany) and 20 mM triethanolamine buffer(pH 7.0) were used. Finally, the enzyme solution was comple-mented with glycerol (f.c. 10%) and stored at 4◦C.2.3. Verification of enzyme purity2.3.1. Protein analysisProtein contents were determined using the Pierce BCA ProteinAssay Kit (Fisher Scientific, Schwerte, Germany) and BSA as thecalibration protein according to the manufacturer’s instructions.SDS-PAGE was carried out using 12% polyacrylamide gels. peq-GOLD Protein Marker II (PeqlabBiotechnologie, Erlangen, Germany)served as molecular mass standard. Gels were stained withCoomassie brilliant blue G-250. For Western blot, proteins weretransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Immuno detection ofStrepII-tagged BliPAE was performed using a Strep-Tactin HRPconjugate (1:1000 dilution; IBA, Göttingen, Germany) accordingto the manufacturer’s instructions. The signal of the horseradishperoxidase coupled to the antibody was imaged in a Fusion-SL VilberLourmat (PeqlabBiotechnologie, Erlangen, Germany) bychemiluminescence detection using luminol-based ECL substrate.2.3.2. Colorimetric determination of acetic acid releasedBliPAE activity was measured colorimetrically using SBP, sun-flower pectin, potato material, apple MHR and okra pectin. Thepectin sample (∼5 mg) was dissolved in 1 ml 50 mM McIlvaine’sbuffer (pH 6.5) incubated at 40◦C for 24 h with an enzyme con-centration of 0.02% (w/w, on protein-substrate basis). The enzymewas inactivated by heating for 6 min at 100◦C. The amount ofacetic acid released was analyzed spectrophotometrically usingthe Megazyme acetic acid kit (Megazyme). The assay was done induplicate.2.3.3. Determination of acetylesterase activity on pNPAEsterase activity was measured using 4-nitrophenol acetate(pNPA) (Sigma, MO, USA). The reaction mixture of 240  l contained12  l of 10 mM pNPA in DMSO, 1  l of BliPAE (1.1 mg/ml) and 227  lof 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.3). The hydrolysis ofpNPA and the formation of p-nitrophenol at 40◦C was continuouslymonitored using a spectrophotometer for 10 min at 405 nm in a 96well microtiter plate. Esterase activity measured was expressed innanokatal (1 nkat is defined as the amount of enzyme required torelease 1 nmol product per second under the defined assay condi-tions). 2.3.4. Determination of acetylesterase activity by pH-statEsterase activity was determined by pH-stat titration usinga thermostated auto-titration system (719 S Titrino, Metrohm,Herisau, Switzerland) as described elsewhere (Pouvreau, Jonathan,Kabel, Hinz, Gruppen, & Schols, 2011). Pectin solution (5 mg/ml)containing 100 mM NaCl was maintained at pH 6.5 at 40◦C by theaddition of 25 mM NaOH.2.3.5. Determination of optimum temperature and pHTemperature and pH optima were determined using SBP as thesubstrate. SBP (B3124, DM 31, DA 24) solution (5 mg/ml) containing50 mM McIlvaine’s buffers at pH 3.0–8.0. Enzymes were added ata dose of 0.02% (w/w on protein-substrate basis). The optimum pHwas determined by analyzing the enzyme activity at pH 3.0–8.0 at40◦C. The temperature profile was determined within the temper-ature range 25–80◦C at pH 6.5. The incubation was performed for10 min. The background level for the spontaneous deacetylation ofthe B3124 (control) was subtracted for all data points. All measure-ments were done in duplicate. At pH 8.0, the substrate was found tobe slightly unstable and released about 2% of the total acetyl groupspresent by auto-hydrolysis.2.3.6. Determination of temperature and pH stabilityTo determine its stability, the enzyme was first incubated atpH 3.0–8.0 using 50 mM McIlvaine’s buffers or at temperatures25–80◦C for 1 h. The residual activity of BliPAE was measured bysubstrate (B3124) addition (5 mg/ml) and incubation at pH 6.5and 40◦C for 10 min. The residual activity was expressed as theremaining activity of the enzyme after incubation for 1 h at givenconditions without the substrate, relative to t the activity of the freshenzyme under these conditions. 2.4. Enzymatic fingerprinting of BliPAE-modified pectins2.4.1. Pectin preparationsSBP sample (5 mg/ml) was treated with BliPAE at a dose of 0.02%(w/w on protein-substrate basis) in 50 mM McIlvaine’s buffers(pH 6.5). The incubation was set at 40◦C for 24 h. Blanks with-out enzyme addition were used as reference. The reaction wasstopped by boiling for 6 min. Further addition of enzyme did notincrease the final acetic acid release indicating that the endpointhad been achieved. Subsequently, the BliPAE-modified SBP was dia-lyzed in milli-Q water overnight, followed by freeze-drying. Thefreeze-dried SBP obtained was re-dissolved (5 mg/ml) in 50 mMsodium citrate buffer (pH 5.0) and digested using the enzymecocktail of purified RG-I and HG degrading enzymes at 40◦C for24 h followed by LC–MS analysis described elsewhere (Remoroza,Buchholt, Gruppen & Schols, 2014).For1H NMR analysis, SBPs (B5519 and B1713, 5 g) was dissolvedin 500 ml demineralized water containing 0.1 g sorbic acid and 2.9 gsodium chloride. The sample was adjusted to pH 6.5 with 1 M NaOHin a 1 l stirred thermostated reactor and heated to 40◦C. A BliPAEenzyme dose at 1% (w/w protein-substrate basis) was added andthe pH was kept at 6.5 by adding of 0.1 M NaOH. Incubation of thesubstrates (B5519, B1713) with BliPAE was 7 h and 4 h, respectively.The endpoint reaction was monitored directly by the pH-stat. Thereaction was stopped by adjusting pH to 3.5 with 1 M hydrochloricacid and heating to 75◦C for 5 min. After cooling to room tempera-ture pectin was precipitated by mixing into 1 l isopropyl alcohol.The precipitate was separated on a screen, dried in an oven at40◦C overnight and the dry pectin was milled using a 0.5 mm sieve.The freeze-dried pectins (B5519, B1713) were characterized by1HNMR.2.4.2. Hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography(HILIC)-MSnSBP digests, diluted to 1 mg/ml in 50% (v/v) acetonitrile,were analysed using an Accela UHPLC system (Thermo Scientific,Waltham, MA, USA) coupled to an evaporative light scatteringdetector (Agilent 1200 series, Gen Tech Scientific, NY, USA) and anESI-IT-MSn-detector (LTQ Velos Pro, Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA,USA). Chromatographic separation was performed on an AcquityUPLC BEH Amide column as described previously (Remoroza et al.,2014). Various pectin samples within the SBP series were modi-fied by BliPAE and analyzed by HILIC-MSnbut only one sample waschosen as the representative of SBPs in Table 1.2.4.3. NMR spectroscopyLiquid state1H NMR spectroscopy was conducted at14.095 Tesla (600 MHz1H frequency) with a 5 mm smart probe anda Bruker Advance III spectrometer. The samples (B5519, B1713)before and after BliPAE treatment were dissolved (5 mg/ml) in D2O(99.9 atom% D, Sigma–Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). NMR spectrawere recorded at a probe temperature of 353 K collecting 64scans. The spectra were acquired using standard pulse sequencesdelivered by Bruker. Chemical shifts are expressed in parts permillion (ppm) relative to internal trimethylsilyl propanoic acid(TMSP).3. Results and discussion3.1. Sequence analysis, production and purification of BliPAEBliPAE, originating from B. licheniformis DSM13, comprises 220amino acids (aa) corresponding to a calculated molecular mass of25.0 kDa and based on homology, BliPAE (acc. no. AAU42913) hasbeen assigned to CE family 12 and annotated as a putative RGAE.BliPAE revealed closest similarity to a 245-aa protein of Bacillus sp.BT1B CT2 (acc. no. WP 009329846; 99.6% identity), annotated asa RGAE. Significant similarity was also seen for a putative PAE ofB. licheniformis SVD1 (acc. no. BAL46009; 224 aa, 89.1% identity).Subjecting the deduced aa sequence of BliPAE to a SignalP analysis(Petersen, Brunak, von Heijne, & Nielsen, 2011), a signal peptidewas not to be predicted.The coding sequence of BliPAE was cloned and heterologouslyoverexpressed in an inducible T7-based E. coli expression strain.In order to facilitate purification, BliPAE was synthesized with aC-terminally attached StrepII tag. Employing conventional IPTG-induced gene expression as well as self-inducing auto-inductionmedium, the latter yielded the highest quantities of BliPAE. Usingthis method, about 2 mg of purified enzyme per 500-ml productionculture were obtained.BliPAE was purified by affinity chromatography. Verificationof enzyme purity and integrity was done using SDS-PAGE andWestern blot analysis (Fig. 1A,B). To unravel faint impurities ordegradation products and to exclude similar-sized contaminatingproteins, different amounts of BliPAE were loaded. The stained SDSgel revealed a single band only, the size of which matching thecalculated molecular mass of tagged BliPAE (26.7 kDa), illustratinghomogeneity of the enzyme purified. In the Western blot a cor-responding strong BliPAE signal was observed. An additional, butvery faint signal represented the biotin carboxyl carrier protein(Choi-Rhee & Cronan, 2003), a biotinylated 16.7-kDa E. coli hostprotein that is co-purified with Strep-tagged proteins, however, innegligible quantities only.
