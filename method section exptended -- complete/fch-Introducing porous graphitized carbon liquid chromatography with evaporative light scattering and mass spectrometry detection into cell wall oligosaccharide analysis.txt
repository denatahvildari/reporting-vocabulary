2.1. Materials
2.1.1. Neutral and acidic homoglycan oligosaccharides
The following components have been used as such: maltodextrins
(-1,4-gluco-oligomers) with an average degree of
polymerization (DP) of 5 (AVEBE, Veendam, The Netherlands) and
cellulodextrins (-1,4-gluco-oligomers) with DP 2–7 (a kind gift
of Dr. Vladimir Farkas, Institute of Chemistry, Slovak Academy of
Sciences, Bratislava, Slovakia).
-1,5-Arabino-oligomers (DP 1–8) were produced by partial
enzymatic degradation of linear arabinan with -1,5-arabinanase
(Aspergillus aculeatus) [15]. A mixture of acetylated -1,4-xylooligomers
derived from Eucalyptus wood has been produced as
described by Kabel et al. [16] (fraction Euc NI A). -1,4-Mannooligomers
were produced by partial enzymatic degradation of
-1,4-mannan derived from Ivory Nut (Megazyme, Bray, Ireland)
with -1,4-mannananase (Aspergillus niger [17]). -1,4-Galactooligomers
were produced by partial enzymatic degradation of
pectic potato galactan (Megazyme, Ireland) with -1,4-galactanase
(A. niger [18]).
Purified fractions of -1,4-galacturonic acids (DP 2–10) as
described by Van Alebeek et al. [19] have been used.
2.1.2. Neutral and acidic heteroglycan oligosaccharides
Xyloglucan oligosaccharides derived from tamarind were
obtained after digestion with xyloglucan specific endo-glucanase
(XEG, A. aculeatus) as described by Hilz et al. [8].
Partially esterified -(1,4)-galacturonic acid oligosaccharides
were obtained by digestion of low methylesterified pectin (DM 30)
with -(1,4)-endo-polygalacturonase (Kluyveromyces fragilis marxianus
[20]).
Oligosaccharides derived from rhamnogalacturonan I were
obtained by saponification of pectic modified hairy regions (MHRB;
[21]) with 0.1M sodium hydroxide followed by treatment with
rhamnogalacturonan hydrolase in overdose [22].
Xylogalacturonan oligomers were produced by treating xylogalacturonan
from gum tragacanth [23] with an overdose of
xylogalacturonan hydrolase (XGH [24]).
2.2. HPLC-ELSD-MSn
Liquid chromatography was performed on a Thermo Accela
UHPLC system (Waltham, MA, USA) equipped with a Hypercarb
column (PGC, 100mm°ø2.1mm; 3m, Thermo Electron Corporation,
San José, USA) in combination with a Hypercarb guard
column (10mm°ø2.1mm; 3m, Thermo Electron Corporation).
Elution was performed with a flow of 0.4 mL/min and a column
oven temperature of 70 ◦C. The injection volume was set to 10L.
The following eluents were used: Millipore water (A), acetonitrile
(B) and 0.2% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in water (TFA, C), to all eluents
25M sodium acetate was added to ensure sodium adducts of all
components. The following gradient was used: 0–1 min, isocratic
100% A, 1–15 min, linear from 0 to 27.5% (v/v) B, 15–28 min linear
from 27.5 to 60% B and concomitant linear from 0 to 10% (v/v) C,
28–31 min linear from 60 to 80% B and from 10 to 20% C, 31–35 min
isocratic 80% B and 20% C, 35–36 min from 80% B and 20% C to 100%
A, 36–41 min equilibration with 100% A.
The PGC-column was coupled to a 1:1-splitter (Accurate,
Dionex, Sunnivale, USA) directing the eluent both to the evaporative
light scattering detector (ELSD 85, Sedere, Alfortville Cedex,
France) and to the ESI-MSn-detector (LTQ XL MS, ion trap, Thermo
Scientific, San Jose, CA, USA). The ELSD micro flow nebulizer
(Sedere, Alfortville Cedez, France) had a gas pressure of 3.5 bar and
a gas flow of 1.75 L/min. The drift tube temperature of the ELSD
was set to 50 ◦C and the gain to 12. MS-detection was performed in
positive mode using a spray voltage of 4.5 kV and a capillary temperature
of 260 ◦C and auto-tuned on malto-pentaose (m/z 851).
The MSn-experiments were performed based on dependent scansettings
(Xcalibur software, Thermo Electron Corporation, San José,
USA). The addition of sodium acetate (25M) in combination with
the use of TFA introduces a significant amount of noise due to the
polymerization of sodium trifluoroacetate (m/z 136). The m/zvalues
originating from the sodium-TFA-complexes are excluded
from the online-MS2 measurements by means of Xcalibur software
(Thermo Electron Corporation, USA). The column was regenerated
with 70 column volumes of tetrahydrofuran after each series of
analysis [25].
