MATERIALS AND METHODSBioinformaticsGenome miningThe genome of A. niger strain CBS513.88, which is a naturalderivative of strain NRRL3122, has been previously sequenced[19]. A list of accession numbers for currently available proteinsequences belonging to family 28 glycoside hydrolases was obtainedfrom the CAZy web-server at http://afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr/CAZY/index.html. The corresponding 309 protein sequenceswere retrieved from the Swiss-Prot database [21] at http://www.expasy.org/sprot/ and used to build a hidden Markovmodel profileusing the HMMER package [22] from http://hmmer.wustl.edu/.The genome of A. niger was screened with the profile obtainedusing the WISE 2 package [23] from http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Wise2/.Sequence analysesTwo-dimensional alignments of identified protein sequences wereperformed using the T-coffee program [24] and manually curated.Dendrograms and distance measurements were performed usingthe Mega 3 software package [25]. Sequences were comparedusing pairwise analysis algorithm. Distances onlywere computed.Gaps/Missing Data were calculated by the pairwise deletionalgorithm. The substitutionmodel usedwas amino p-distancewithall substitutions included. Homogeneous pattern among lineagesand uniform rates among sites were applied. Dendrograms wereconstructed using the Neighbour-Joining Method with the samedistance parameters as described above. The nucleotide sequencesreported in the current paper have been submitted to the DDBJ,EMBL and GenBank® Nucleotide Sequence Databases underthe accession numbers DQ374422 to DQ374431, DQ417225 andDQ417226.Verification of intron positions by RT (reverse transcriptase)-PCRTotal RNA was isolated from frozen ground mycelia usingTRIZOL® reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’sinstructions. RNA concentrations were estimated using a Nano-Drop® ND-1000 spectrophotometer. cDNAs of pgxC and rgxAwere amplified by two step RT-PCR. In the first step, 1.5 μg oftotal RNA from 2 h transfer cultures on D-galacturonic acid andL-rhamnose respectively were used as a template in the reversetranscription reaction. Omniscript® RT (Qiagen) was used as describedin the manufacturer’s protocol. In the second step,RT-PCRwas performed with 1 μl of product from the reverse transcriptionreaction using 2.5 units of SuperTaq Plus polymerase (SphaeroQ)under standard PCR conditions. Prior to sequencing, two overlappingfragments per mRNA were amplified with the followingprimers, for the amplification of the pgxC 5 fragment: pgxCAFw5-CGTCATGTCTGTCTTCAAGG-3 and pgxCBRv 5-TGATACTGTCGGTGATCTGG-3; for the amplification of the pgxC3 fragment: pgxCDFw 5-CACTGCGGTGCAGAATATAG-3and pgxCCRv 5-GCGTTCATGCAGATCACACT-3; for theamplification of the rgxA 5 fragment: rgxAAFw 5-GGTATCGAGGTGAGCCAGGA-3 and rgxABRv 5-TATGGTCGGATCGGTACGTG-3; for the amplification of the rgxA 3 fragment:rgxADFw 5-GGCTGTTCTTGTCGATTCCT-3 and rgxACRv5-CAGCGACAGCTCACGAATTG-3. RT-PCR products weregel purified with QIAquick® gel extraction kit (Qiagen) and outsourcedto BaseClear Labservices (BaseClear B.V., Leiden, TheNetherlands) for sequence determination.Transcriptional profilingStrains and growth conditionsWild-type strain A. niger N400 (CBS 120.49) was used in alltranscriptional profiling experiments.For growth, 300 ml of minimal medium [26] (pH 6.0) containing0.1%(w/v) yeast extract and Vishniac trace elements [27]with 2% (w/v) D-fructose as a sole carbon source was inoculatedwith 106 spores/ml and cultivated at 30◦C at 250 rev./minin an orbital shaker. After 18 h of incubation, mycelium wereharvested on a B¨uchner funnel with nylon gauze, washed oncewith sterile 0.9%(w/v) NaCl and aliquots of 1.5 g (wetweight) ofmycelium was transferred to 50 ml of minimal medium (pH 6.0)containing 0.1% (w/v) yeast extract, Vishniac trace elementsolution and 1% (w/v) of the various sole carbon sources: Dfructose(Merck), D-glucose (Merck), D-galacturonic acid (FlukaChemica), L-rhamnose (ACROS Organics), D-xylose (Merck),D-sorbitol (Merck), PGA (polygalacturonic acid; United StatesBiochemical Corporation) and SBP (sugar beet pectin; GENU,Copenhagen). At 2, 4, 8 and 24 h after transfer, mycelium washarvested on a B¨uchner funnel with nylon gauze and immediatelystored at −70◦C. The amount of monomeric sugars remaining inthe culture fluid was assessed by standard HPLC techniques [7].RNA manipulations and microarray processingBefore and during microarray processing RNA quality wasverified by analysing aliquots with 1%TAE (Tris/acetate/EDTA)agarose gel electrophoresis and the Agilent Bioanalyzer ‘Labon-chip’ system (Agilent Technologies). mRNA levels wereassessed using custom made ‘dsmM_ANIGERa_coll’ AffymetrixGeneChip® Microarrays kindly provided by DSM Food Specialties(Delft, The Netherlands).Probe labelling, hybridization and scanningTotal RNA from mycelium samples were amplified, labelledand hybridized strictly following the Affymetrix protocolsfor ‘Eukaryotic Target Preparation’ and ‘Eukaryotic TargetHybridization’. For probe array wash and staining the ‘AntibodyAmplification Washing and Staining Protocol’ was used. Probearrays were scanned with an Agilent Technologies G2500A GeneArray Scanner at a pixel value of 3 μm and a wavelength of570 nm. Raw intensity measurements and present/absent callswere derived using Microarray Suite Software version MAS5(Affymetrix) after applying the ‘Mask all outliers’ algorithm. Allchip data were scaled to an arbitrary target gene intensity of 500. Cloning and overexpression of enzymesPGXA, PGXB and RGXB were overexpressed in A. nigerPlugBug® [28] and kindly supplied by DSM Food Specialities(Delft, The Netherlands).Cloning and overexpression of PGXCMolecular work was essentially carried out using standard techniquesdescribed previously [29]. All enzymes were used accordingto the instructions provided by the supplier. A. niger genomicDNA was isolated as described [30]. A PCR fragment containingthe rgxC gene (1.5 kb) was amplified using primers PGXCFw5-TGGCATGGCAATTGGAGACC-3 and PGXCRv 5-GTGTGGCTTCCTGTGGATGG-3. The obtained product was used as a template in a subsequent nested PCR reaction usingprimers PGXC3NsiIFw 5-GCATCGTCATGCATGTCTTC-3and PGXCNotIRv 5-TGGCGGCGGCTGGATGGCTTA-3 forthe introduction of restriction sites NsiI and NotI at the ATG startcodon and 73 bp downstream of the stop codon of the pgxC generespectively. Both PCR and nested PCR were performed usingPfu Turbo polymerase (Stratagene). The nested PCR product wasdigested with NsiI and NotI, gel-purified using the QIAquick® gelextraction kit (Qiagen) and ligated into plasmid pIM3710 [31],resulting in the pgxC overexpression vector pIM5150.Transformation of A. niger NW188 (cspA1, pyrA6, leuA1,prtF28, goxC17) was performed as previously described [32]using 1 μg of pGW635 [33] and 20 μg of co-transformingpIM5150. Control transformation with 1 μg of pGW635 wasperformed in parallel. Determination of positive transformantsand enzyme production were performed as described [34] withthe following modifications: STREAMLINE SP and citrate buffer(pH 3.8) were used instead of Sephadex-DEAE and 10 mMpiperazine/HCl. Following dialysis, further purification stepswere performed as described below.Enzyme purification and gel electrophoresisPGXA, PGXB, PGXC and RGXB were purified by dialysisovernight at 4 ◦C against 50 mM NaOAc (pH 5.7) and subsequentsize-exclusion chromatographywas performed on aHiLoad 16/60Superdex 75 column (Amersham PharmaciaBiotech) equilibratedwith 50 mMNaOAc (pH 5.7). The elutionwas carried out with thesame buffer at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, and fractions of 2 ml werecollected. Protein homogeneity was determined by SDS/PAGE ona 8–25%polyacrylamide gradient gel under reducing conditions,using the PhastSystem following the manufacturer’s protocol(Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The gels were stained withCoomassie Brilliant Blue. Low molecular mass standard proteins(14.4–94 kDa) were used to determine the molecular mass of thepurified enzymes.SubstratesPGA and XGAXGA-25 was prepared from gum tragacanth by treatment withalkali and TFA (trifluoroacetic acid) and had a xylose/galacturonicacid ratio of 1:4 [35]. PGA was from ICN Biomedials. Assubstrates for rhamnosidase activity, p-nitrophenyl-α-L-rhamnopyranoside(pnp-Rha; Sigma), naringin (Sigma) and hesperidin(Fluka) were used.Amidated and methylated pectinThree commercial pectins, A, B and E, extracted from lemonpeels, were obtained fromDegussa Texturant Systems SAS. Thesepectins were partially methyl-esterified with a degree of methylesterificationof 74%, 72% and 30% respectively, where thedistribution of methyl esters was blockwise for pectin A andrandom for pectin B [36].Two other commercial pectins, O5 andO27, were obtained fromDanisco. These pectins had a degree of amidation of 5%and 27%respectively. Prior to use, the methyl esters were removed fromO5 and O27 by saponification [37]. Saponified amidated pectinsare referred to as O5sap and O27sap.Linear RG oligosaccharidesa-MHR-S (saponified applemodified ‘hairy’ region)was preparedas described [38]. Enzymatic liquefaction of apples for the preparationof a-MHR-S was performed with a commercial enzymepreparation (Ultra-SP; Novozymes). This substrate was furthertreated with RGH and fractionated by HPSEC (high performancesize exclusion chromatography) as described previously [39].Fractions 45–60, which contained oligomeric products as determinedby HPSEC analysis, were pooled and freeze-dried. Asthis material still contained some polymeric residue, further fractionationwas performed by gel filtration on a Sephadex G50column (GE Health Care), using Millipore water as the eluent ata flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions 89–100, which contained primarilyoligosaccharides as determined by HPSEC analysis, werepooled and subsequently freeze-dried. This pool is referred to asa-MHR-S-fr1. Since the activity of a RG rhamnohydrolase and aRG galacturonohydrolase towards RG oligosaccharides is hinderedby Gal side chains [40], a-MHR-S-fr1 was treated with β-galactosidase [41] for 19 h at 40◦C in 20 mMBis-Tris (pH 5). Thefinal protein concentration was 2.2 μg/ml. The enzyme was inactivatedby heating for 10 min at 100◦C. Subsequently, β-galactosidasetreated a-MHR-S-fr1 (a-MHR-S-fr1-g) was desalted ona Biogel P2 column (Bio-Rad) using Millipore water as theeluent at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. After desalting, a-MHRS-fr1-g was analysed by MALDI-TOF (matrix-assisted laserdesorptionionization–time-of-flight) MS [39], for the presenceof RG oligosaccharides. Four linear RG oligosaccharides weredetected at m/z 539, m/z 685, m/z 861 and m/z 1007. Based on themode of action of RGH towards RG, it was concluded thatthe produced RG oligosaccharides with a m/z at 685 and m/zat 1007 correspond to rhamnose–galacturonic acid–rhamnose–galacturonic acid and galacturonic acid–rhamnose–galacturonicacid–rhamnose–galacturonic acid respectively. The RG oligosaccharidesat m/z 539 and at m/z 861 correspond to galacturonicacid–rhamnose–galacturonic acid and galacturonic acid–rhamnose–galacturonic acid–rhamnose–galacturonic acid. Asthese latter two oligosaccharides cannot be produced directly fromRGH-treated RG it is assumed that these oligosaccharides areformed due to side activities in the RGH preparation, in particularRG rhamnosidase activity.Enzyme activity measurementsPGXA, PGXB, PGXC and RGXB were analysed for their activitytowards 0.25% (w/v) PGA, 0.25% (w/v) XGA-25, and 0.25%(w/v) of the pectins, encoded as A, B, C, O5sap and O27sap.Exo-PG from Aspergillus tubingensis [42] was included as areference. The action of RGXB was also studied towards 0.25%(w/v) narigin, 0.25%(w/v) hespiridin, 0.02%(w/v) pnp-Rha and0.5%(w/v) a-MHR-S-Fr1-g. For comparison, this latter substratewas also treated with RG galacturonohydrolase from Aspergillusaculeatus [43]. All digests were made in 50 mMNaOAc (pH 4.0)for 16 h at 30◦C. The final protein concentration was 1 μg/ml.Enzymes were inactivated by heating the reaction mixtures for10 min at 100◦C. All digests were analysed by HPSEC andHPAEC (high performance anion exchange chromatography), asdescribed previously [44], except for RG galacturonohydrolase orRGXBtreated a-MHR-S-Fr1-g, whichwere analysed byMALDITOFMS as described previously [39]. Products released fromXGA-25 and PGA after 1 h of incubation with PGXA, PGXB,PGXC or exo-PG were also analysed by HPAEC.The specific activity of PGXA, PGXB, PGXC and exo-PG wasdetermined towards 0.25% (w/v) PGA and 0.25% (w/v) XGA-25, as described previously [34]. Specific activity is in units/mgof enzyme, where 1 unit is defined as 1 μmol of reducing sugarreleased per min. The influence of pH on enzyme activity wasdetermined as described previously [34]. Identification of the RGXC protein sequence by MS analysisTryptic digest of RG galacturonohydrolase from A. aculeatusThe protein concentration of RG galacturonohydrolase [43] wasdetermined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories) and themolecule subsequently digested with trypsin as described previously[45]. The tryptic digest was subsequently acidified topH 3.0 by the addition of 10% formic acid. The sample wasthen analysed by nano-RPLC/MS/MS (nano-reverse-phase liquidchromatography tandem MS).Nano-RPLC/MS/MSNano-RPLC/MS/MS analysis of the tryptic peptides was performedon an integrated Famos/Switchos/Ultimate 1D/2D nanoflowHPLC system (LC Packings, a division of Dionex), asdescribed [46] with the following adaptations. The peptides werefirst trapped on a LC Packings C18 precolumn [300 μmi.d. (innerdiameter)×5 mm, 100 Å (1 Å=0.1 nm)] and eluted after desaltingonto a Pep Map C18 resolving column (3 μm, 100 Å, 75 μmi.d.×15 cm, LC Packings, Dionex) using the following elutionprofile: a linear gradient of increasing acetonitrile concentration inwater (5–30%) over 40 min, isocratic at 30%for 5 min, a lineargradient (30–95%) over 30 min, isocratic at 95% for 5 min. Alleluents contained 0.05%formic acid as the ion-pairing agent.The electrospray needlewas operatedwith a voltage differentialof 3.0 kV, and the heated desolvation capillary was held at 180 ◦C.The specific mass-to-charge value of each peptide sequenced byMS/MS was excluded dynamically from reanalysis for 2 min.Analysis of MS/MS and MS3 dataData analysis of each raw tandem spectrum was performed asdescribed previously [47] with adaptations. Processed tandemmass spectra were correlated with the various public proteindatabases and the A. niger protein database (DSM, Delft,The Netherlands) using the program Bio Works 3.1 (ThermoFinnigan). The allowed mass tolerance range between expectedand observed masses for search was +−1.0 Da for MS peaks, and+−0.1 Da for MS/MS fragment ions. The correlation results werethen filtered using the value of the cross-correlation score and thematched sequence for each spectrum. For singly charged peptides,spectra with a cross-correlation score to a tryptic peptide 1.5were retained. For multiple-charged peptides, spectra with a crosscorrelationto a tryptic peptide 2 were retained. All spectra withcross-correlation scores not meeting these criteriawere eliminatedfrom further consideration.
