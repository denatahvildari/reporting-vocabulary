2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
All chemicals used were at least of analytical grade. Water was
purified by a MilliQ®-system (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). Acetonitrile
(ACN) was of ULC/MS grade and was purchased from
Biosolve (Valkenswaard, The Netherlands). Formic acid and ammonium
formate were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich (Steinheim,
Germany). Ammonium acetate and ammonium hydroxide were
purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany).
Samples of -(1,5)-arabinose, -(1,4)-glucose, -(1,4)-glucose,
-(1,4)-mannose, -(1,4)-xylose, -(1-4)-galactose, -(1,4)-
galacturonic acid and xylogalacturonan oligosaccharides were
obtained as described by Westphal et al. [12]. Partially methyl
esterified -(1,4)-galacturonic acid oligosaccharides were obtained
after digestion of 30%-methyl esterified pectin (DM30) with endopolygalacturonase
from Aspergillus niger. A mixture of partially
saturated, unsaturated and methyl esterified -(1,4)-galacturonic
acid oligosaccharides was obtained after digestion of 56%-methyl
esterified pectin (DM56) with endo-polygalacturonase and pectin
lyase (both from A. niger). Partially methyl esterified and acetylated
galacturonic acid oligosaccharides were obtained after
modification and digestion of sugar beet pectin with fungal pectin
esterase as described earlier [28]. Sugar beet pulp hydrolysates
were obtained from Cosun Food Technology Centre (Roosendaal,
The Netherlands). The hydrolysates were prepared by digestion
of sugar beet pulp with a mixture of commercially available
pectinases.
All samples were diluted to 1 mg/ml. Samples were diluted with
50:50 (v/v) ACN/water and centrifuged as a compromise between
analyte solubility and optimal peak shape and preventing polymeric
material to be injected onto the column.
2.2. Hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography with
evaporative light scattering and mass spectrometry detection
UPLC–ELSD–MSn method development was carried out on an
Accela UHPLC system (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) coupled
to an evaporative light scattering detector (ELSD 85, Sedere,
Alfortville Cedex, France) and an ESI-MSn-detector (LTQ XL MS,
ion trap, Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA, USA). Chromatographic
separation was performed on an Acquity UPLC BEH Amide column
(1.7 m, 2.1 mm
°ø
150 mm) in combination with a VanGuard
precolumn (1.7 m, 2.1 mm
°ø
5 mm; Waters Corporation, Milford,
MA, USA). Elution was performed at a flow rate of 600 L/min and
a column oven temperature of 35 ◦C. The injection volume was
set to 10 L. In order to prevent distorted or split peaks in the
chromatograms a strong and weak needle wash procedure was
applied. Strong and weak needle wash solvents contained 20:80
(v/v) ACN/water and 75:25 (v/v) ACN/water, respectively. Three
double stage mobile phases have been evaluated, varying in pH
and buffer composition. Mobile phase at aqueous pH 3 was composed
of (A) 80:20 (v/v) ACN/water and (B) 20:80 (v/v) ACN/water.
To both eluents 10 mM ammonium formate and 0.2% (v/v) formic
acid were added. Mobile phase at aqueous pH 6.8 was composed
of (A) 80:20 (v/v) ACN/water and (B) 20:80 (v/v) ACN/water, with
10 mM ammonium acetate added to both eluents. Mobile phase at
aqueous pH 10 was composed of (A) 80:20 (v/v) ACN/water and
(B) 20:80 (v/v) ACN/water, with 0.1% (v/v) ammonium hydroxide
added to both eluents. Optimal run time for separation of various
oligosaccharides was 40 min using the following gradient elution
profile: 0–1 min, isocratic 100% A; 1–31 min, linear from 30 to
80% (v/v) B; followed by column re-equilibration: 31–32 min linear
from 20% A to 100% A; 32–40 min, isocratic 100% A. Gradient
steepness was adjusted for samples containing components with
particularly high or low retention in order to obtain improved separation.
The Acquity BEH Amide column was coupled to a 1:1-splitter
(Accurate, Dionex Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) directing the
eluent both to the ELSD and to the ESI-MSn-detector. The ELSD
micro flow nebulizer (Sedere, France) had a gas pressure of 3.5 bar
and a gas flow of 1.75 L/min. The drift tube temperature of the
ELSD was set to 50 ◦C and the gain to 12. MS-detection was performed
in negative mode with the ion source voltage set to
−4.5 kV,
capillary voltage
−5 V, capillary temperature 350 ◦C, sheath gas 40 (arbitrary units), auxiliary gas 5 (arbitrary units) and auto-tuned
on tetragalacturonic acid (m/z 721). Mass spectra were acquired
over the scan range m/z 150–2000. MSn-collection parameters
included normalized collision energy 30 (arbitrary units), activation
Q 0.25 (arbitrary units), activation time 30 ms and isolation
width 2 m/z. Data were processed using XCalibur software (Thermo
Scientific).
