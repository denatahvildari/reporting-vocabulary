CopT was then purified to apparent
homogeneity by size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex
200 10/300 GL column (Amersham Biosciences), which was preequilibrated
with buffer S (20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7?0, 0?1 M NaCl,
10 mM DTT). Fractions containing pure CopT were pooled and
flushed in an anaerobic chamber to remove residual oxygen molecules.
Recombinant CopT was stored at 4 uC. Typically, a 500 ml
expression culture harvested approximately 5 mg electrophoretically
pure CopT.
