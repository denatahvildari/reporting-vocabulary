Purification. Virus from the two 350-L (working volume)
bioreactors was harvested via a sieve (mesh 75 ??m) to obtain a
virus harvest free of micro-carriers [13]. Clarification was done
using normal flow filtration with a Millipore POD-holder
containing C0HC depth filters followed by an Express SHC
0.45/0.22 ??m combination filter (Millipore) [3,13] .
Concentration was done by tangential flow filtration using 100
kDa filters [13]. Purification was done by size exclusion
chromatography (Sepharose CL-6B (GE Healthcare) [11,29];
elution buffer 20mM phosphate buffer pH 7.0) and ion
exchange chromatography (DEAE-Sephadex A50 (GE
Healthcare) [11,30]; elution buffer 20mM phosphate buffer
pH7.0).
