 Size exclusion chromatography-multi-angle laser light
scattering
Size exclusion chromatography-multi-angle laser light
scattering (SEC-MALLS) was used to analyze the serum
phase. The SEC-MALLS measurement was performed
using 200 mL sample loop, PW6000 and 3000XL columns
thermostated at 60 1C, Dawn DSP-F MALLS, and Betron
ERC-7510 (BETRON Scientific) refractometer thermostated
at 40 1C. Buffer of 125mM LiNO3, 5mM KH2PO4
and 5mM K2HPO4 (pH 6.7) was used as the mobile phase.
Size exclusion chromatography was performed at a
constant flow rate of 0.5mLmin1. The light source was
GaAs laser with 690 nm wavelength. Scattering signals
were collected at 15 different angles from 201 to 1531. Berry
plot was used for the detector fitting method. The detection
limit for gellan gum was 0.01% (w/w). All solutions were
pre-filtered through a 0.2-mm pore size PTFE filters
(Whatman) before injection.
