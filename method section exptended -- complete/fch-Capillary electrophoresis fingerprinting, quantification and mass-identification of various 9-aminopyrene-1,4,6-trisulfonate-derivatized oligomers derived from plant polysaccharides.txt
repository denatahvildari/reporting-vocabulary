 2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
Various standard mono and oligosaccharides were used:
d-Glucose (Boom); d-xylose (Merck); d-galactose (Aldrich);
l-rhamnose (Janssen-Chimica); d-arabinose (Sigma–Aldrich);
d-mannose (Merck); d-glucuronic acid (Fluka); l-fucose
(Merck).
Maltodextrins (-1,4-gluco-oligomers) having a degree of
polymerization (DP) of 1–25 (Beckman Coulter); cellulodextrins
(-1,4-gluco-oligomers) DP 1–8 (gift of the Institute
of Chemistry Slovak Academy of Sciences); -1,4-mannooligomers
DP 1–6 (MegaZyme); -1,5-arabino-oligomers DP
1–8 (MegaZyme); -1,4-xylo-oligomers DP 1–6 (Megazyme).
Furthermore, acetylated -(1,4)-xylo-oligosaccharides
(AcXOS) were purified from hydrothermally treated Eucalyptus
wood as described previously [35,36]. The AcXOS-mixture
(163 mg in 2 mL) was fractionated further [36] by using
a Pharmacia system equipped with a BioGel P-2 column
(900mm°ø26 mm; 200–400 mesh, Bio-Rad Laboratories)
thermostated at 60 ◦C. Elution was performed at 0.5 mL/min
with water (60 ◦C) and fractions were collected every 2 mL.
The eluent was detected by a Shodex RI-72 detector. Two of
these fractions, named X4Ac (about 1 mg/mL) and X3Ac (about
1 mg/mL), were fractionated further by using reversed phase
HPLC and analysed by CE-LIF.
Linear unsubstituted -(1,4)-xylo-oligosaccharides (XOS)
were prepared by alkali removal (50mMNaOH) of the O-acetyl
substituents from acetylated -(1,4)-xylo-oligosaccharides.
2.2. CE-LIF
For capillary electrophoresis–laser induced fluorescence
mono- and oligosaccharides were derivatized with 9-
aminopyrene-1,4,6-trisulfonate (APTS) using the ProteomeLab
Protein Characterisation kit (Beckman Coulter). Hereto, samples
of 0 to 50 nmol of monosaccharide or of about 0.1 mg of
carbohydrate were dried under liquid nitrogen (SpeedVac). To
the dried saccharides, 2L of 0.2MAPTS diluted in 15% acetic
acid (Beckman Coulter) and 2 L of 1M sodiumcyanoborohydride/
THF (Sigma–Aldrich) were added. This blend was mixed
thoroughly and incubated for 90 min in a 60 ◦C water bath.
Before drying and labeling to each sample 5 nmol of maltose
was added as internal quantification standard. Also, maltose was
used as mobility marker. The derivatized sample was diluted
5–50 times with pure water prior to CE-LIF or not at all prior to
CE-ESI-MSn.
The derivatized oligosaccharides were separated on a
polyvinyl alcohol (N CHO) coated capillary (50.2 cm°ø50m
I.D., detector after 40 cm, Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, USA)
using a ProteomeLab PA 800 characterisation system (Beckman
Coulter) and a laser induced fluorescence detector (LIF) at
an excitation of 488 nm and an emission of 520 nm (Beckman
Coulter). Samples (20–200L.) were subjected to CE analysis
and aliquots (ca. 4.5 nL) were loaded hydrodynamically (4 s at
0.5 Psi). The separation was carried out in the reversed polarity
mode at 30 kV in a 25mM acetate buffer containing 0.4%
polyethylene oxide at pH 4.75. The capillary was kept at 25 ◦C.
2.3. CE-UV-ESI-MSn
For identification of APTS-derivatized oligomers, separation
was carried out on a P/ACE MDQ capillary electrophoresis
system (Beckman Coulter) with a fused silica capillary
(80 cm°ø50m I.D.) connected to a UV-detector (after 20 cm)
and an ESI-MSn detector (LTQ Ion-trap, Thermo Electron) by
inserting the capillary in a sheat-liquid coupled needle, made in
our laboratory [37]. Samples (4 L) were subjected to CE-MS
analysis and aliquots (ca. 22 nL) were loaded hydrodynamically
(10 s at 1 Psi). The separation was carried out in reversed polarity
at 28 kV in a 50mM ammonium acetate solution containing
0.5% formic acid at pH 2.4. The capillary inside the cartridge
was kept at 15 ◦C, to reduce an increase in temperature caused by
current as much as possible, and outside the cartridge at room
temperature (air-conditioned at 20 ◦C). For ESI-MSn a sheat
flow of 3–4 L/min of 75% isopropanol in water was used. ESIMSn
was operated in the negative mode using a spray voltage
of 1.9 kV and a capillary temperature of 190 ◦C and auto-tuned on  APTS-derivatized glucohexaose (Sigma). MS2  and higher
was performed using a window of 1m /z  and a relative collision
energy of 30%.
2.4. Reversed phase HPLC (offline) and CE
 Reversed phase HPLC was performed on a HPLC system
(Thermo Separation Products) equipped with a Thermohypersil
Aquasil C18 column ((Keystone Scientific); 150mm°ø 4.6mm
I.D.; 3 m) in combination with a Thermohypersil Aquasil
C18 guard column (10mm°ø 4.6mm I.D.; 3 m). The RPcolumn
was coupled to a splitter (Dionex) directing 10% of
the eluent to an evaporative light scattering detector (ELSD
2000; Alltech) and the remaining part to a fraction collector
(0.4 min/fraction). Elution (0.8 mL/min) was performed using
a gradient of degassed (Membrane degasser; Thermo Separation
Products) methanol in pure water: 0–28% (v/v) methanol
in 0–70 min. Each elution was followed by an equilibration step
(isocratic pure water; 30 min).
These fractions were analyzed on matrix-assisted laser desorption/
ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDITOF-
MS) and depending on the peak height 50–200  L per
RP-HPLC-fraction was used for APTS-derivatization and analysis
on CE.
2.5. MALDI-TOF-MS
 MALDI-TOF-MS was performed using an Ultraflex instrument
(Bruker Daltonics) equipped with a nitrogen laser of 337-
nm and operated in the positive mode. After a delayed extraction
time of 200 ns, the ions were accelerated to a kinetic energy
of 12 kV. Hereafter, the ions were detected using the reflector
mode. The lowest laser power required to obtain good spectra
was used and at least 100 spectra were collected. The mass spectrometer
was calibrated with a mixture of maltodextrins (mass
range 365–2309).
The samples were mixed with a matrix solution (1 L of
sample in 1  L of matrix). The matrix solution was prepared by
dissolving 9mg of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (Bruker Daltonics)
in a 1-mL mixture of acetonitrile:water (300  L:700 L).
Of the prepared (sample + matrix) solutions 1  L was put on a
MALDI-TOF-plate (Bruker Daltonics) and allowed to dry under
a constant stream of air.
