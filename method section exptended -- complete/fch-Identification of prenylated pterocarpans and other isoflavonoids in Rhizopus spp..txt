EXPERIMENTAL
Materials
Soya beans, Glycine max (L.) Merrill, were provided by
Frutarom Belgium (Londerzeel, Belgium). Authentic standards
of genistein, daidzein and coumestrol were purchased
from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Ultra-highperformance
liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (UHPLC/MS) grade acetonitrile (ACN) was purchased from
Biosolve BV (Valkenswaard, The Netherlands). Water was
prepared using a Milli-Q water purification system (Millipore,
Billerica, MA, USA). All other chemicals were
purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany).
The fungus, Rhizopus microsporus var. oryzae (LU 581), was
purchased from the Fungal Biodiversity Centre CBS (Utrecht,
The Netherlands).
Soya bean germination and challenging with Rhizopus
The soya beans were surface-sterilised by soaking them in a
1% (w/v) hypochlorite solution (5 L kg
1 beans) under
continuous stirring for 1 h at 208C. Subsequently, the soya
beans were rinsed with sterile Milli-Q water and soaked for
4 h at 408C in sterile Milli-Q water. After soaking, the beans
were germinated in 370mL glass jars of which the bottom was
covered with Whatman filter paper (type 520 A), humidified
with sterile Milli-Q water to prevent the beans from drying
out. The lids of the jars were loosely closed, and Parafilm was
loosely wrapped around the lid to allow air passage. The
beans were incubated for 4 days at 308C in the dark.
After germination, the beans were inoculated with Rhizopus
microsporus var. oryzae (LU 581). For the fungal inoculation, a
sporangiospore suspension was prepared by scraping off the
sporangia from pure slant cultures of this fungus, grown on
malt extract agar (CM59; Oxoid, Basingstoke, UK) for 7 days
at 308C. Subsequently, the sporangia were suspended in
sterile Milli-Q water with 0.85% (w/v) NaCl (108 colonyforming
units (CFU) mL
1). The beans were inoculated with
the sporangiospore suspension (0.2mLg
1) and incubated
for 4 days at 308C in the dark.
Soya bean extraction
Non-soaked soya beans, soaked soya beans and Rhizopus-
challenged germinated soya beans were freeze-dried,
after which they were milled with a Retsch Ultra centrifugal
mill ZM 200 (Haan, Germany) using a 1mm sieve. The meal
was defatted by hexane extraction for 30 min in a sonication
bath at 308C (0.04 g meal mL
1 hexane) followed by
air-drying of the residue. The flavonoids were extracted
with absolute ethanol (0.04 g meal mL
1 EtOH) by a two-step
sequential extraction of the defatted powder, each for
30 min in a sonication bath at 308C. The extracts were
centrifuged (2500 g, 15 min at 208C). The dried extracts were
obtained after evaporation and were subsequently, dried, resolubilised
in methanol (MeOH) to a concentration of
10mgmL
1 and stored at 208C. All samples were thawed
and centrifuged before analysis.
RP-UHPLC analysis
Samples were analysed on a Thermo Accela UHPLC system
(San Jose, CA, USA) equipped with pump, autosampler and
PDA detector. Samples (1mL) were injected on a Waters
Acquity UPLC BEH shield RP18 column (2.1150mm,
1.7mmparticle size) with a Waters Acquity UPLC shield RP18
Vanguard pre-column (2.15 mm, 1.7mm particle size;
Waters, Milford, MA, USA). Water acidified with 0.1% (v/
v) acetic acid, eluent A, and ACN acidified with 0.1% (v/v)
acetic acid, eluent B, were used as eluents. The flow rate was
300 mL min
1, the column oven temperature was controlled at
258C, and the PDA detector was set to measure the range
200–400 nm. The following elution profile was used: 0–2 min,
linear gradient from 10%–25% (v/v) B; 2–9 min, linear
gradient from 25%–50% (v/v) B; 9–12 min, isocratic on 50%
B; 12–22 min, linear gradient from 50%–100% (v/v) B;
22–25 min, isocratic on 100% B; 25–27 min, linear gradient
from 100%–10% (v/v) B; 27–29 min, isocratic on 10% (v/v) B.
Electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (ESI-MS)
Mass spectrometric data were obtained by analysing samples
on a Thermo Scientific LTQ-XL (San Jose, CA, USA) equipped
with an ESI probe coupled to the RP-UHPLC system. Helium
was used as sheath gas and nitrogen as auxiliary gas. Data
were collected over the m/z range 150–1500. Data-dependent
MSn analysis was performed with a normalised collision
energy of 35%. The MSn fragmentation was always
performed on the most intense product ion in the MSn–1
spectrum. Most settings were optimised via automatic tuning
using ‘Tune Plus’ (Xcalibur 2.07, Thermo Scientific). To this
end, the system was tuned with genistein in both positive
ionisation (PI) and negative ionisation (NI) mode. For both
modes, the ion transfer tube temperature was 3508C and the
source voltage 4.8 kV. Data acquisition and reprocessing were
done with Xcalibur 2.07 (Thermo Scientific).
