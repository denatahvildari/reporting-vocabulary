Isolation of polysaccharide-producing bacteria
Slime samples were collected from submerged and
unsubmerged wet end surfaces of two Finnish ( Fin B) and one Spanish (Spa) paper mill. Ten grams of
the slime sample was homogenised with 90 ml of sterile
0.9% NaCl solution. Spread plate cultures were made of
the dilutions 102 –106  on agar plates containing: glucose
(20 g/l), yeast extract (0.5 g/l), (NH4 )2 SO4  (0.6 g/l),
KH2 PO4  (3.18 g/l), K2 HPO4  (5.2 g/l), MgSO4· 7H2 O
(0.3 g/l), CaCl2  (0.05 g/l), ZnSO4· 7H2 O (0.2 mg/l),
CuSO4· 5H2 O (0.2 mg/l), MnSO4· H2 O (0.2 mg/l),
CoCl2  (0.2 mg/l), FeSO4· 7H2 O (0.6 mg/l) agar (20 g/l).
The plates were incubated inverted at 30 C and at 50 C.
Slimy colonies were picked from the plates and twice
purified on same agar medium.
Identification of isolates
The isolates were ribotyped using the standard method
of the automated RiboPrinter  System (DuPont
Qualicon, Wilmington, DE, USA) and Eco RI restriction
enzyme as described by Bruce [3 ]. The similarity
of the generated patterns was compared with the
identification patterns existing in the RiboPrint databases
of Oualicon (Release12.2 c 2000) and VTT
Biotechnology [33 ]. In order to form a dendrogram
the generated ribogroups were transferred to the Bio-
Numerics programme (Applied Maths, Sint-Martens-
Latem, Belgium), where clustering was carried out
using Pearson correlation and a Ward dendrogram
type. In addition, the patterns of 13 relevant type
strains (T) and of Serratia fonticola  E-991258 were
included from the database of VTT as references. The
isolates were also subjected to partial 16S rDNA
sequencing (around 450 nucleotides between 1 and
600 bp of the 16S rRNA gene according to Escherichia
coli  numbering) as described by Suihko and Stackebrandt
[39 ] or Saarela et al. [35 ]. Finally, the sequences
were compared to the GenBank sequences using the
BLAST search [1 ]. In addition, the 16S rDNA of some
strains was analysed by using the ARB program
package [38 ]. The alignment was based on secondary
structure, and performed using the automatic aligner
function (Version 2.0) of the ARB aligner (ARB_EDIT4)
including manual evaluation. The physiological
properties were performed using API identification
strips ID 32 GN and ID 32 E according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (BiomeÅLrieux SA, Marcy-lÅLEtoile,
France).
Production of polysaccharides
The isolates were cultivated for 5 days at 30 C in shake
flasks in liquid medium with the same composition as
the agar medium used for isolation containing
(NH4 )2 SO4  (0.6 g/l) (medium I), Bacto tryptone (Difco)
(5 g/l) (medium II) or Bacto tryptone (Difco) (1 g/l)
(medium III) as nitrogen source. Culture filtrate viscosities
were measured using a Brookfield DV II viscometer
at 20 C.
Isolation of polysaccharides
A 0.9% NaCl was added to the culture medium, the
medium was lightly homogenised for 30–45 s and centrifuged
at +4 C, 14,700·g  for 45 min to separate the
cells. Three volumes of ice-cold 100% ethanol was added
to the supernatant. If the precipitate did not form at
once, the solution was let to precipitate at 4 C overnight.
The precipitate was either collected with a spoon and a
strainer or it was centrifuged at +4 C, 4,000·g  for
15 min. The precipitate was solubilised in a small volume
of distilled water, dialysed using Medicell Visking
(MWCO 12-14000 dalton) dialysis tube and freeze dried.
Analysis
Protein
 Protein contents of the freeze-dried polysaccharides were
estimated by Lowry method [23 ].
Sugar composition
 The EPS sugar composition was determined using
methanolysis as described by De Ruiter et al. [9 ]. The
EPS was treated with 2N HCl in dry methanol for 16 h
at 80 C, followed by 1 h of 2N CF3 CO2 H (TFA) at
121 C. The released sugars were analysed using High
Performance Anion Exchange Chromatography
(HPAEC) with Pulsed Amperometric Detection (PAD)
as described by Verhoef et al. [43 ].  MALDI-TOF MS
For Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionisation Time-
Of-Flight +Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) a
Ultraflex workstation (Bruker Daltronics GmbH, Germany)
was used. The mass spectrometer was calibrated
with a mixture of malto-dextrins (mass range 365–
2,309). The samples were mixed with a matrix solution
(1 ll of sample in 9 ll of matrix). The matrix solution
was prepared by dissolving 9 mg of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic
acid in a 1 ml mixture of acetonitrile : water
(300 ll:700 ll). The prepared sample and matrix solutions
2 ll were put on a gold plate and dried with warm
air.
 Sugar linkage analyses
The EPS sample was methylated according to Hakomori
[17] and subsequently dialysed against water and evaporated
in a stream of dry air. The methylated samples
were hydrolysed using 2 M TFA (2 h, 121C). After
evaporation in a stream of air ( T<20C), the partially
methylated sample was converted to alditol acetates
and analysed by GC-FID [11]. Identification  compound was performed using GC-MS as described by
van Casteren et al. [42 ].
Determination of the pyruvate and O-acetyl content
 The amount of pyruvate was determined according to
Troyano et al. [41 ]. The EPSs (1 mg) were dissolved in
1 ml of 1 N TFA and hydrolysed for 6 h at 120 C. The
hydrolysate was centrifuged and analysed at 40 C using
a Thermo Quest HPLC system equipped with both a
Shodex RI71 refractive index detector and a Thermo
Separation Products Spectra System UV2000 UV
detector at 220 nm. HPLC separation was performed
using a Bio-Rad Aminex HPX-87H column using
0.01 N H2 SO4  (0.6 ml/min) as a mobile phase. The
amount of pyruvate is calculated using a calibration
curve of 0.2–2 mM sodium pyruvate. The acetyl content
was determined after saponification with 0.4 M NaOH
in 50%(v/v) isopropanol/water according to Voragen
et al. [45 ] using the same chromatographic system.
Partial hydrolysis
 The EPS (3–4 mg) was dissolved in 1 ml 0.05 N TFA
and subjected to partial hydrolysis for 1 h at 100 C.
After hydrolysis the samples were cooled, dried in a
stream of dry air and redissolved in water before
MALDI-TOF MS analysis.
