2.1. Materials. Dextran with an Mw of 282 kDa was
purchased from Sigma Chemicals. PEOs with Mw values of
100 and 200 kDa were purchased from Fischer Scientific. The
dextran was used without further purification. PEO was
purified before use. This was done by dissolving the powder
in reversed osmosis (RO) water by stirring with a magnetic
stirrer at room temperature. After 24 h, the solution was
centrifuged (60 min, 11000g), and the supernatant was freezedried.
Before using this material, the molar mass distribution
was measured with a size exclusion chromatograph equipped
with a multiangle laser light scattering detector (SEC-MALLS)
(see Table 1). Clear solutions were prepared by gravimetrically
adding solvent (RO water with 0.02% sodium azide to prevent
bacterial growth) to the appropriate amount of material.
Dextran dissolves readily at room temperature. PEO was
dissolved with stirring of the solution overnight.
