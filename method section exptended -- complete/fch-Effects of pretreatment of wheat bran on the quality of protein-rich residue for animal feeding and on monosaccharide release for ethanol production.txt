2. Methods
2.1. Experimental design
Effects of pretreatment conditions in a steam reactor for wheat
bran were assessed in a study with a 4  2  2 experimental design
with the factors temperature (120, 140, 160 and 180 C), pH (2.3 and
3.9) and RT (5 and 10 min). The range for each of the parameters was
adjusted to the process requirements for ethanol production from
wheat bran. Treatments were applied without replication; however
one treatment (140 C, pH 2.3, 10 min) was repeated four times in
order to provide insight into the variability of the process.
2.2. Wheat bran pretreatment and enzyme hydrolysis
2.2.1. Hydrothermal pretreatment
Wheat bran (Cargill, Sas van Gent, The Netherlands) was ground
in a hammer mill over a sieve of 400 lm. For each treatment, 77 g
of ground bran (Table 1) was sampled from the same batch of
wheat bran and mixed with demineralized water in a vessel of
1 L to obtain a mixture of 600 mL and 12% dry matter (DM). The
wheat bran slurry was stirred with a magnetic stirrer for 5 min
to obtain a homogeneous suspension. Sulfuric acid (H2SO4) was
added to the slurry at 2 or 1% (w/w), mixed for 20 min before measuring
the pH. The pH (mean ± SD) was 2.29 ± 0.02 and 3.86 ± 0.02
for the pH treatment targets of 2.3 and 3.9, respectively. The wheat
bran slurry underwent a hydrothermal pretreatment in a steam
reactor (Series 4520 1 L bench top reactor, Parr Instrument Company,
IL, USA), equipped with an electric heater as well as a highpressure
steam-heating circuit. During pretreatment, the wheat
bran slurry was continuously stirred at 300 rpm. The temperature
was raised to 40 C with an electric heater before the steam circuit
was opened (20 bar, 210 C) to allow for a rapid increase to the
preset temperature. When this temperature was reached, which
typically occurred within approximately 2 min, the steam circuit
was closed and the preset temperature was maintained during
the process time by the electric heater. At the end of the pretreatment,
fresh water (10 C) was passed through the steam circuit,
allowing for rapid cooling of the slurry. The slurry was transferred
to a 1-L plastic pot and stored at 20 C until chemical analysis.
2.2.2. Enzyme hydrolysis
Pretreated wheat bran was subjected to enzymatic hydrolysis
with commercial enzyme preparations, Spirizyme and Termamyl
for starch hydrolysis, and Celluclast 1.5L and Novozym188 for
cellulose hydrolysis (Novozymes, Bagsværd, Denmark). Hemicellulases
(Sørensen et al., 2007) were also used, and included two
a-arabinofuranosidases (Mastigoproctus giganteus GH51 and Humicola
insolens GH43), one endoxylanase (H. insolens GH10) and one
b-xylosidase (Trichoderma reesei GH3) (kindly provided by
Novozymes, Bagsværd, Denmark). Enzymes were dosed as 0.1%
(g enzyme protein/g DM substrate). Prior to incubation, the pH in
pretreated samples, corresponding with 250 mg DM, was adjusted
to 6.0 by adding NaOH with 0.05% sodium azide. The samples were
incubated with Termamyl for 1 h at 80 C, cooled to 30 C, and the
pH was adjusted to 4.3 by adding H2SO4 before the other enzymes
were added. The samples were incubated head-over-tail for 48 h at
32 C, and finally heated for 5 min at 100 C to inactivate the
enzymes. Monosaccharides were determined after enzymatic
hydrolysis.
2.3. Analytical methods
The slurry samples were freeze-dried, milled over a 1-mm sieve
using a Retsch mill (ZM 100, Retsch GmbH, Haan, Germany) and
stored at 4 C pending analysis. Dry matter was determined by drying
to a constant weight at 103 C according to ISO 6496. Nitrogen
was determined by the Kjeldahl method and crude protein content
was calculated as N  6.25 (ISO 5983). Crude fat (ISO 6492), crude
ash (ISO 5984) and lignin (ISO 13906) were determined in the raw
wheat bran only. Amino acids were measured in all slurry samples
by conventional amino acid analysis (ISO 13903). After centrifugation
(10,000g for 30 min), amino acids were measured in the solid
and liquid phase separately for all treatments with a RT of 10 min.
Samples of 5 mg were hydrolyzed with 1 mL of 6 mol/L glass
distilled HCl for 24 h at 110 ± 2 C in glass tubes, sealed under vacuum.
Subsequently, the tubes were opened and 200 lL of 2.5 lmol norleucine was added to each tube as an internal standard, after
which the contents of the tubes were dried under vacuum (Savant
SpeedVac Concentrator SC210A, Savant Instruments Inc., Farmingdale,
NY, USA). The samples were loaded onto an ion exchange HPLC
(Biochrom 20 Plus, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Staffanstorp,
Sweden) employing postcolumn derivatisation with ninhydrin and
detection at 570 nmwith proline detected at 440 nm. The chromatograms
were integrated using specific software (Chrom-Card version
2.3.3, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) with amino acids identified
and quantified by retention time against a standard amino acid
mixture. Tryptophan and cysteine were not determined. The crosslinked
amino acids lysinoalanine and lanthionine were assessed
using standards obtained from PolyPeptide Laboratories (Strasbourg,
France). The amount of OMIU-reactive lysine was determined
in triplicate according to the method of Moughan and Rutherfurd
(1996) and amino acid analysis described above. O-methylisourea
(Fluka) and the L-homoarginine standard (Sigma) were purchased
from Sigma Aldrich (Zwijndrecht, The Netherlands).
The total carbohydrate content, and carbohydrate composition
was determined by gas chromatography (GC), using inositol as
internal standard (Englyst and Cummings, 1984). The samples were
treated with 72% (w/w) H2SO4 (1 h, 30 C) followed by hydrolysis
with 1 M H2SO4 for 3 h at 100 C. The constituent sugars released
were analyzed as their alditol acetates by GC. Monosaccharide
analysis was performed using a Dionex ICS 3000 High Performance
Anion Exchange Chromatography (HPAEC) system (Sunnyvale, CA,
USA), with pulsed amperometric detection. Samples were diluted
500  with water before analysis and 20 lL was injected into the
system. Separation was achieved using a CarboPac PA-1 column
(2  250 mm) preceded by a CarboPac PA-1 guard column
(2  250 mm). The monomers in the samples were eluted with a
gradient of 0.02–0.05 M NaOH for 3 min and 0.05–0.075 M NaOH
for 10 min, followed by isocratic elution of 0.1 M NaOH for 2 min.
Subsequently, the column was washed with 1 M NaOAc in 0.1 M
NaOH for 7 min. Equilibration of the column was achieved in
0.1 M NaOH for 3 min followed by 0.02 M NaOH for 20 min.
Furfural and 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furfural (5-HMF), by-products
which can be formed when respectively hexoses and pentoses are
degraded, were determined by HPLC using an Aminex HPX-87H
column and UV-/RI-detection (280 nm) in soluble hydrolysates
from pretreated wheat bran. Acrylamide, which is formed in an
advanced Maillard reaction from aspartic acid, was measured in
the untreated wheat bran and in the four samples pretreated at
180 C. Acrylamide was quantified by LC–MS/MS with positive
electrospray ionization using an Applied Biosystem API 4000 triple
quadrupole mass spectrometer (Darmstadt, Germany) coupled to
an Agilent 1100 LC system (Waldbronn, Germany), as previously
described by Hoenicke and Gatermann (2005). The degree of
browning of the samples, as a measure of melanoidin formation,
was determined by liberation of brown pigments from protein
molecules by means of the proteolytic enzyme pronase according
to the method of Palombo et al. (1984).
The digestibility of proteins in the pretreated samples was assessed
in vitro by subsequent incubation with pepsin (at pH 1)
and pancreatin (at pH 6.8) according to the method of Babinszky
et al. (1990).
All analyses were performed in duplicate, apart from amino acid
and OMIU-reactive lysine analyses which were performed in
triplicate.
2.4. Calculations
The combined severity (CS) factor (R0
0), a factor allowing
comparison of results among experiments carried out under different
conditions of pH, temperature and RT (Chum et al., 1990), was
calculated as follows:
R0
0 . .10  pH  t  exp..T100.=14:75 .1.
where pH is the acidity level, t is the RT in min and T is the temperature
in C. The results are presented as a function of log(R0
0).
The coefficient of variation (CV) was calculated from measurements
(n = 4) in the repeated sample (140 C, pH 2.3, 10 min).  All parameters were analyzed for main effects of temperature,
pH and RT, and their two-way interactions by the generalized linear
model procedure in SAS 9.2 (SAS Inst. Inc., Cary, NC, USA):
Y . l . Ti . Aj . Rk . eijkl .2.
where Y is the dependent variable, l is the mean, Ti is the effect of
temperature i (120, 140, 160 or 180 C), Aj is the effect of acidity j
(pH 2.3 or 3.9), Rk is the effect of retention time k (5 or 10 min), and
eijkl is the residual error term. Only main effects could be statistically
evaluated. Results are reported as means with their standard error.
