MATERIALS AND METHODSStrains, plasmids, and media. All strains and plasmids used or constructed inthis study are listed in Table 1. Lactococcal strains were grown in M17 broth(Difco, Detroit, Mich.) supplemented with lactose (LM17) or glucose (GM17) asan additional carbon source at a final concentration of 0.5% (wt/vol). If appropriate,chloramphenicol or erythromycin was added to the medium to a finalconcentration of 5 g/ml. Strains were grown at either 28 or 40°C. The ability ofstrains to produce 3-methylbutanal was determined by static headspace gaschromatography (37) analysis after 24 h of growth (optical density at 600 nm,1.8) in the presence or absence of 2 mM KICA in 10-ml HS vials containing3 ml of culture medium.Escherichia coli was grown aerobically at 30°C on TY medium (Difco), whichcontained 200 g of erythromycin per ml if appropriate.DNA handling procedures. Before the protocols used for DNA isolation wereperformed, L. lactis cells were pretreated for 10 min with 2 mg of lysozyme perml in THMS buffer at 37°C. Plasmid DNA was isolated with a Micro plasmidprep kit (Amersham/Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden), and total DNA was isolatedwith an AquaPure genomic DNA isolation kit (Bio-Rad, Veenendaal, The Netherlands) used according to the manufacturer’s protocols. L. lactis cells weretransformed by electroporation as described previously (41). Agarose gel electrophoresiswas performed as described by Sambrook et al. (30). DNA fragmentswere isolated from agarose gels by using a gel purification kit (Jetstar; Genomed,Bad Oeynhausen, Germany). Restriction enzymes, T4 ligase, and other DNAmodifyingenzymes were purchased from Promega Corp. (Leiden, The Netherlands)or Invitrogen (Carlsbad, Calif.) and were used as recommended by themanufacturer. PCR was performed by using a Pwo polymerase PCR kit (Roche,Mannheim, Germany) and the primers listed in Table 2 with total DNA preparationsas templates. Twenty-six thermal cycles with a Mastercycler (Eppendorf,Hamburg, Germany) were used with the 50-l reaction mixtures. Each cyclestarted with 30 s at 95°C, which was followed by annealing for 30 s at 55°C andelongation for 3.5 min at 72°C. Sequencing was performed with a ThermoSequenase Cy5.0 Dye terminator cycle sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia),and separation was performed with an Alf sequencer (Amersham Pharmacia).Construction of a random mutant library. A random insertion mutant librarywas constructed by using the thermosensitive plasmid pGh9:ISS1 as described byMaguin et al. (22, 23). The pGh9:ISS1 plasmid was isolated from E. coli(pGh9:ISS1) and transformed into L. lactis B1157. Erythromycin-resistant, plasmidcontainingtransformants were selected at a permissive temperature, 28°C. Twenty-five milliliters of LM17 without erythromycin was inoculated (1%) withB1157(pGh9:ISS1), and the organism was grown at 28°C for 2.5 h; this wasfollowed by transfer of the cultures to a nonpermissive temperature, 40°C, for2.5 h to force random plasmid integration into the genome of strain B1157. Morethan 8,500 integrants were selected on LM17 agar containing 2 g of erythromycinper ml; individual colonies were organized in 384-well microtiter platescontaining LM17 with erythromycin and 20% glycerol, and the plates werefrozen at 80°C. It was calculated that a library consisting of 8,000 mutants wasneeded so that 95% of the genes were represented by an integrant, assumingrandom insertion into the genome, a genome size of 2.3 Mb, and an average genesize of 880 kb (8). The frequency of integration was determined to be 2.4%, andthe library was analyzed for the presence of random integrants by Southernblotting. For this purpose total DNAs of 20 strains from the insertion sequence(IS) library were isolated and cut with either EcoRI or HindIII. The fragmentsobtained were separated on a 0.7% agarose gel, blotted, and hybridized withHindIII-cut, digoxigenin-labeled pGh9:ISS1 (Roche) as the probe. Eighty percentof the colonies gave fragments that were different sizes.For determination of the site of integration in 3-methylbutanal-negative clonesB2083 and B2084, total DNA was digested with HindIII or EcoRI and subsequentlyligated by using T4 ligase. Ligation mixtures were used to transform L.Lactis MG1363 that was grown at the permissive temperature (28°C). Plasmidsequencing was performed by using the four pGh9:ISS1-derived primers (Table2). The HR and HF primers were used for the plasmids derived from HindIIIdigestedtotal DNAs, and the ER and EF primers were used for the plasmidsoriginating from the EcoRI-digested total DNAs.Identification of decarboxylase knockouts. Decarboxylase-negative clones inthe mutant library were identified by fast screening of volatile compounds producedin miniaturized fermentations as described previously (36). Briefly, themethod is based on the growth of individual mutants in a 96-well stainless steelblock containing 2-ml wells filled with 1 ml of LM17 with 2 mM KICA. The blockis closed airtight, and after fermentation for 24 h at exactly 40°C, individualheadspace samples (100 l) were analyzed by using direct inlet mass spectrometry(Trace-MS; Interscience, Breda, The Netherlands) at a throughput rate ofone sample per minute (36). The amount of 3-methylbutanal present in thesample was calculated from the response at m/z  58.Overexpression of the decarboxylase gene. To further analyze the function ofthe decarboxylase gene products, plasmids were constructed for nisin-dependentoverexpression of the ipd gene from IL1403 (1,374 bp), the kdcA gene fromB1157 (1,644 bp plus 166 bp), and a truncated kdcA gene from B1157 (1,569 bp,missing 75 bp) (Fig. 1). The fragments were obtained by PCR by using twoprimer pairs, primers IL1403-10fw and IL14031374R and primers IL1403-10fwand B11571793Rev (Table 2), with total DNAs of L. lactis IL1403 and L. lactisB1157, respectively. Thirty thermal cycles with the following steps were used:denaturation at 95°C for 30 s, annealing at 55°C for 30 s, and elongation at 72°Cfor 120 s. The PCR products obtained were digested with Nco1-XbaI and clonedinto pNZ8148, resulting in plasmids pNZ7502 (containing IL1403 ipd) andpNZ7500 (containing the B1157 decarboxylase gene). The PCR product obtainedfrom B1157 was also digested with SpeI and NcoI and cloned intopNZ8148, generating pNZ7501 (containing the B1157 decarboxylase gene lacking75 bp at the 3 terminus). The identities and integrities of the inserts clonedin pNZ8148 were confirmed by sequencing. All plasmids were introduced intostrain NZ9000 (20) and used for nisin-controlled overexpression of the cloned(partial) genes by previously established procedures (10).Colony PCR. L. lactis strains B1021, B1152, B1156, B1157, B1158, B1165,B1231, B1233, B1235, B1236, B1275, B1492, B2085, B234, B25, B26, B27, B28, B31, B4, B40, B42, B48, B643, B697, B698, B700, B76, B77, B78, B78, B79, B80,B81, B83, IL1403, NZ9000(pNZ7502), NZ9000, and SK110, obtained from theNIZO culture collection, were grown overnight in 1 ml of GM17 broth. A 0.5-lportion of a bacterial cell suspension was treated twice for 30 s in a microwaveat 750 W. Four PCRs were performed for each strain by using the four possiblecombinations of primers B11573fw, B1157623fw, B11571303Rev, andB11571633Rev (Table 2 and Fig. 1). Using these primers should have resultedin either four fragments (complete kdcA gene present), two fragments (truncatedkdcA gene present), or no fragments (no kdcA gene present). Thirty thermalcycles with the following steps were used: denaturation at 95°C for 30s, annealingat 40°C for 30 s, and elongation at 72°C for 120 s.Overproduction of decarboxylases. For overproduction of decarboxylases, anovernight culture of L. lactis NZ9000 harboring either pNZ7500, pNZ7501, orpNZ7502 was transferred (1%) to fresh medium (GM17) and grown until anoptical density at 600 nm of 0.5 was reached. The cells were induced with 0.2 or2 ng of nisin ml1 and grown for another 2 h. The cells were then harvested, andthe cell extracts (CFEs) were prepared as described below. These extracts wereused for the enzymatic assays and protein analysis.Preparation of CFEs. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed twicein 25 mM sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.5). The cells were disrupted by the FastPrep method (Bio 101, Savant, Holbrook, N.Y.) twice for 30 s. The supernatantafter centrifugation at 20,000  g for 15 min was used as the CFE. All steps wereperformed at temperatures below 6°C.Protein analysis. Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis(PAGE) with a 12% polyacrylamide gel in a mini Protean II system(Bio-Rad) was used to analyze the production of the protein. Protein concentrationswere determined in triplicate by using a BCA protein assay reagent kitobtained from Pierce Inc. (Rockford, Ill.). A 30-l sample was mixed with 240 lof work reagent. After incubation at 37°C for 20 min, the optical density at 562nm was measured with a Spectra max (Molecular Devices, Sunnydale, Calif.).Triplicate measurements were obtained independently.KdcA assay. The -keto acid decarboxylase assay with KICA was performed asdescribed previously (37). In essence, an enzyme sample was incubated for 3 h at30°C in a closed 10-ml HS vial at pH 6.3 (50 mM sodium citrate) with 10 mMKICA as the substrate and with 1 mM MgCl2 and 0.1 mM TPP as cofactors. After3 h the reactions were quenched by lowering the pH to between 2 and 3 with 6N HCl. The production of 3-methylbutanal was quantified by static headspacegas chromatography as described previously (37). Gas chromatography enableddetection of the aldehyde of interest only, and a CFE of strain MG1363 was usedas a negative control. The conversion rate was calculated by dividing the amountof product formed (in micromoles) by the reaction time (in minutes) and theprotein content of the sample (in milligrams).Characterization of KdcA. For the characterization experiments CFE of overexpressingstrain B2085 was used in the KdcA assay, and the pH was variedbetween 4 and 9 by using sodium citrate, sodium phosphate, and Tris buffers.NaCl was added at concentrations ranging from 0.05 to 1.1 M. The substratespecificity of the decarboxylase was determined by measuring the decreases inthe specific substrates by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatographyor ion-exchange high-performance liquid chromatography as described previously(35). The reaction mixture described above was used. The amount of cellextract of strain B2085 was adjusted for each substrate used; our aim wasconversion of about 30% in 3 h. The following substrates were used at a finalconcentration of 10 mM (all substrates were obtained from Sigma, Zwijndrecht,The Netherlands, or Fisher, Landsmeer, The Netherlands) (2-oxo  -keto):2-oxo-4-methylpentanoic acid (-ketoisocaproic acid or KICA), 2-oxo-3-methylpentanoicacid, 2-oxo-3-methylbutanoic acid, 2-oxohexanoic acid, 2-oxopentanoicacid, 2-oxobutanoic acid, pyruvic acid, 4-methylthio-2-oxobutanoic acid,phenylpyruvic acid, indole 3-pyruvate, 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-oxopropanoic acid,2-oxopentanedioic acid, 4-methylpentanoic acid, 3-methylbutanoic acid, and2-methylpropanoic acid. The conversion rate was calculated by dividing theamount of substrate converted (in micromoles) by the reaction time (in minutes)and the protein content of the sample (in milligrams).Sequence homology analysis and homology modeling. Homology relationshipswere established by using BLASTP (1) and TBLASTX (2), and multiple-sequencealignments were constructed with ClustalW (15). Homology modeling ofKdcA and IPD of L. lactis IL1403 was performed with the program WHAT IF(39) by using the structure of yeast pyruvate decarboxylase (PDB code 1QPB) asa template. The 1QPB structure consists of a dimer with bound Mg2 ions, TPP,and pyruvamide. The results of the modeling were visualized by using ProteinExplorer (http://molvis.sdsc.edu/protexpl/frntdoor.htm; copyright 1998–2003 byEric Martz).Nucleotide sequence accession number. The sequence of the kdcA gene hasbeen deposited in the GenBank database under accession number AY548760.
