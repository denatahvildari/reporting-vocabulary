 EXPERIMENTAL
Non-Aqueous Reversed Phase HPLC-TLS
The set-up (Figs.1a and 1b) used in this study is characteristic for the HPLCTLS
spectrometer, operated at an oblique incidence angle. The pump source is
a home-made line-tuneable and free-running (long-term power stability  0.5%) cw CO waveguide laser (PuL); its cooling jacket was maintained at –
658 C by means of a CB 90-10 cryostat from Heto. The output power of the
laser was measured by a 4501 power detector (PM) from Spectra Physics
and the identity of emission line controlled by the mirror (M0 ) and the
spectrum analyser (SA) from Optical Engineering.
A gold-coated flat brass mirror (M1 ) reflects the periodically modulated
(PTI 400 mechanical chopper (CH) from Photon Technology) pump laser
beam towards the f .  50mm ZnSe lens (L1 ) from Janos Inc. that focuses
the IR radiation into a home-made HPLC cell (SC) mounted on a translation-
rotational stage (in order to facilitate alignment). The exploded view
of (SC) is shown in Fig. 2. The pump radiation enters (SC) through a cone
made in the flange (A) carrying the “O” ring (B) and 2mm thick sapphire
(Melles Griot) window (C). The flange is bolted to the aluminium block (D)

 that accommodates a chamber with 0.2mm thick separating walls (G), each
provided with a circular opening (H) 1mm in diameter. Standard fitting (E)
was used to achieve (see also Fig. 1b) the coupling between (SC) and the
outlet/ inlet tubing, while Teflon cylinder (F) in Fig. 2 served to reduce the
size of the dead volume.
The NARP-HPLC-TLS analysis of the mixture of underivatized fatty
acids was accomplished with a double stage isocratic HPLC pump
(Gynkotek M3000 CS) mounted (Fig. 1a) in series with a 12-0125 pulse
damper (D) from Scientific Systems Inc., a multisingle multiport stream
switch (Spark Holland BV) injector equipped with a 10 m L Rheodyne
injection loop (L) and the end-capped Vydac 218TP54 RP-18
(250   4.6 mm, particle size diameter 5m m) chromatographic column (C).  The mobile phase (MP) (80% acetonitrile and 20% chloroform, both HPLC
grade) was transported through a tubing (inner diameter 1/ 800 ) and entered
the (SC) from below (see direction of arrows in Figs. 1a, 1b and 2). The
diameter of the cylindrical channel used to transport mobile phase through
the HPLC cell is 0.4mm. Both solvents have good thermal properties and
their absorption, around 1740 cm21 , is not too high (coefficients 0.5 cm21
 for chloroform and 8.0 cm21  for acetonitrile), as compared to the typical
value (2000 cm21 ) for the free fatty acids. The (SC) was mounted (Fig. 1a)
in series with the Showa Denko KK RI-71 refractive index detector (RID),
the output of which was connected to the x-t recorder (REC) and personal
computer (PC3 ).  The model mixture of three free fatty acids, a product of FDH Manchester,
contained 20% oleic acid C18:1 (9) cis, 70 % linoleic acid C18:2
(9,12) cis, cis, and 10% of conjugated linoleic acid C18:2 (9,11) cis, cis. In
addition, in some experiments, high purity hexanoic acid C6:0 (Acros
Organics, Geel), oleic acid C18:1 (9) cis (Sigma, Deisenhofen), and conjugated
linoleic acid C18:2 (9,11) cis, cis (Merck, Darmstad) were used to
prepare a series of test solutions. Octanol and decanol were both from Merck.
The strength of the thermal lens induced in the sample was sensed (Figs.
1a and 1b) by the 8mW He-Ne 632.8 nm probe beam laser (PrL) from
Uniphase 1304P. The f .  250mm glass lens (L2 ) focuses (Figs. 1a and 1b)
the probe beam radiation to a spot located about 5 cm ahead of (SC). The
pump and probe laser beams intersect in (SC) at approximately 158 . After
emerging from (SC), the pump beam is reflected to a flat mirror (M2 ) and
directed towards the home-made photopyroelectric detector (PPED) made
from PVDF film. The output voltage from the (PPED) detector was fed to
3691 single-phase lock-in amplifier (LI1 ) from Ithaco. The probe beam,
however, is reflected at a flat, gold coated brass plane mirror (M3 ) and sent
to a Thorlabs photodiode (PD) provided with a central pinhole (PH) with a
diameter of 1 mm. Finally, the output from (PD) is fed into a SR-830 twophase
lock-in amplifier (LI2 ) from Stanford Research; the voltage thus
obtained (thermal lens signal) is representative for the strength of the
thermal lens. The same chopper (CH) provided reference signals for both
lock-in amplifiers; the integration time was set to one second. Using
(PPED) to monitor the power of the CO laser is a necessity because the
thermal lens signal detected at the selected analytical wavelength must be normalised.
Data acquisition and the normalisation of data were performed by
two personal computers (PC1 ) and (PC2 ); the HPLC/ TLS chromatograms
were displayed during each run.  Argentation HPLC-TLS
The concept of the HPLC-TLS as a detector of IR absorbance was also applied
in the combination with argentation chromatography Ag-HPLC-TLS and

used to analyse two different model mixtures of fatty acid methyl esters
(FAMEs). Its performance was evaluated and compared to that of a conventional
UV absorbance detector. The set-up used (Figs. 1a and 1b) was the
same as described above for NARP-HPLC-TLS, the only exception being
the 200  4mm i.d. column (Nucleosil 100-5 SA (strong cation exchanger,
5mm particle size) from Macherey and Nagel, Du¨ren, Germany. It was
loaded with Agﬂ according to the procedure described by Christie.[24] The
column was mounted in series (Figs. 1a and 1b) with the above described
(SC) and 757 UV absorbance detector (Applied Biosystems) set to 210 nm.
A mixture of acetonitrile and n-hexane (0.4 to 99.6% (v/v)) at a flow rate
of 1mL/min was used as eluent. These two constituents possess reasonably
good thermal properties, but their absorption (8.0 cm21 for acetonitrile and
4.8 cm21 for and n-hexane) at the analytical wavelength of the CO laser
cannot be neglected.
Two FAME mixtures were studied here: the first one contained 50.7 mg
C18:0 FAME, 5.3 mg C18:1 FAME, 1.5 mg C18:2 FAME, 1.6 mg C18:3
FAME and 5.3 mg C22:1 FAME in 10mL n-hexane. The second mixture
comprised 50 mg of each FAME (C18, C18:1, C18:2, C18:3 and C22:1) in
10mL n-hexane. Based on the known extinction coefficients, 1, of each constituent
at 210 nm (1 increases with the extent of unsaturation), the amount of
each FAME was selected such as to have approximately the same absorbance
and, hence, also give comparable signals at the UV detector. Concerning the
UV response, the latter increases in the order: saturated , monounsaturated
, diunsaturated , triunsaturated. On the other hand, all FAMEs
present in the second mixture are expected to give comparable TLS signals
in the IR. Our own independent UV and FTIR measurements of C18 FAME
show that absorban absorbance of this substance in IR is about 20 times larger than
that at 210 nm.
