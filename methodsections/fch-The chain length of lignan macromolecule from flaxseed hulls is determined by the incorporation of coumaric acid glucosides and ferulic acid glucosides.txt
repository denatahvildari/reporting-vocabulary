4. Experimental
4.1. Extraction lignan macromolecule from flaxseed hulls
Lignan macromolecule was extracted from flaxseed hulls as described
previously (Struijs et al., 2007). In short, 400 g of flaxseed
hulls, kindly provided by Frutarom Netherlands B.V. (Veenendaal,
The Netherlands), were extracted with 3 l of n-hexane. Lignan macromolecule
was extracted from the defatted hulls by a three-step
sequential extraction with 63% (v/v) aq. EtOH at room temperature
under continuous stirring. The extracts and the hulls were separated
by filtration on a 595 round paper filter (Schleicher&Schuell).
From the combined extracts the EtOH was evaporated and the concentrated
extract was lyophilized yielding lignan macromolecule.
4.2. Saponification of lignan macromolecule
To release monomeric constituents, solutions of (fractions of)
lignan macromolecule were fully saponified in 75 mM NaOH. The
incubation volume was 1 ml, the concentration lignan macromolecule
was 2 mg/ml or less. Saponification was performed at room
temperature while stirring. After 24 h, the reaction was stopped
by lowering the pH to 6.5–7.0 with HOAc.
4.3. Sample clean up of (saponified) lignan macromolecule
Prior to analysis, low molecular weight polar material was removed
from lignan macromolecule extract or saponified samples
by solid phase extraction (SPE; SepPak Vac, 20 cc/5 g, C18 cartridge,
Waters). Prior to loading samples onto the SPE cartridge,
the EtOH concentration in the reaction mixture was reduced by
diluting the samples with 25 ml water.
After activation of the SepPak cartridge first with MeOH and followed
by water, the diluted saponified lignan macromolecule solution
was loaded onto the cartridge. After a wash step with 1
column volume of water, lignans were eluted from the cartridge
with 3 column volumes of MeOH of which the first column volume
was discarded. The MeOH eluate was evaporated under a stream of
air to a final volume of 1 ml.
4.4. Reversed phase HPLC coupled on-line to mass spectrometry (RPHPLC-
MS)
Samples were analyzed on an X-Terra C18 MS column (Waters;
3.5 lm particle size, 4.6  150 mm) with an X-Terra C18 MS guard
column (Waters; 3.5 lm particle size, 4.6  10 mm) run on a Thermo
Separation Products HPLC system as previously described
(Struijs et al., 2007). The gradient (Struijs et al., 2007) was run at
0.7 ml/min at room temperature. Samples of 20 ll were injected
being dissolved in MeOH.
The molecular masses of the constituents of the macromolecule
were determined on a Thermo Finnigan LCQ Classic coupled online
to the analytical RP-HPLC. 10% of the flow from the analytical
RP-HPLC was directed to the MS. The MS was equipped with an ESI
injector. Spectra were obtained in the negative ion mode over an
m/z range of 150–2000. The capillary temperature was 270 C, the ion spray voltage was set on 4.50 kV, the capillary voltage was
7.00 V, and helium was used as sheath gas. MS/MS analysis was
performed with a normalized collision energy of 27%.
4.5. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC)
To obtain fractions of lignan macromolecule with different
molecular masses, aliquots of 100 ll containing 2 mg lignan
macromolecule (cleaned over SPE)/ml 63% (v/v) EtOH were injected
on a similar HPLC system as described for RP-HPLC,
equipped with a Tricorn Superdex Peptide 10/300 GL column
(Amersham Bioscience; 10  300–310 mm, bed volume = 24 ml,
optimum separation range 100–7000 Da). Fractions (0.8 ml)
were collected during three subsequent runs. The column was
run isocratically at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min with 40% (v/v)
aq. ACN + 0.1% (v/v) TFA as eluent. The eluate was monitored
at 280 nm. The included volume (Vinc = 16.5 ml) was determined
with water. No further calibration of the Superdex Peptide column
was performed since no suitable calibration compounds
were available.
The same procedure was used to determine the molecular
weight distribution of the GPC-fractions isolated from the parental
lignan macromolceule. The injection volume was 50 ll.
4.6. Determination molar extinction coefficients of CouAG, FeAG, HDG
and SDG
CouAG, FeAG, HDG and SDG were purified by preparative RPHPLC
as described previously (Struijs et al., 2007). Based on
stock-solutions of about 10 mg/ml, dilution series in MeOH were
made. The absorbance at 280 nm of these dilutions was measured
against MeOH in a 1 ml quartz cuvet. The molar extinction coefficients
(e) were calculated using Abs = e * l * c in which Abs = absorbance
at 280 nm, l = light path = 1 cm, c = concentration (M).
4.7. Determination HMGA by GC-MS
Lignan macromolecule (2 mg/ml in EtOH) was fully saponified.
Aliqouts (0.5 ml) were spiked with 50 lg glutaric acid (GA) dissolved
in water (50 ll, 1 mg/ml) as internal standard. A calibration
curve was made with a concentration range of HMGA
(Aldrich) starting from a 1 mg/ml stock-solution. The volume
was increased to 5 ml with water and the pH was adjusted to
pH 1.5–2.0 with HCl. The samples were evaporated to dryness under
a stream of air at 50 C. To remove residual water, 100 ll acetone
was added and evaporated. Reaction vials were purged with
N2.
To obtain TMSi derivatives, to each dried sample 1 ml of
HMDS:TMCS:pyridine (3:1:9; SIL-PREP Kit, Alltech) was added.
After 2 h the derivatisation reaction was complete and the derivatized
samples were analyzed on a GC 8000TOP system with an
AS800 autosampler and FID-detection (Thermo Finnigan) equipped
with a DB-1 column (J&W; 30  0.25  1.0). Injection volume was
1 ll (splitless injection). The temperature program was a follows:
t = 0 min, 80 C; t = 0–12 min, 80–325 C (linear increase); t = 10–
42 min, 325 C. Helium was used as a carrier gas at 100 kPa. The
FID-detector was set on 350 C.
GC-MS data were obtained by analyzing the derivatized samples
on a Trace GC (Thermo Finnigan) coupled to a Polaris Q mass
spectrophotometer. The settings of the GC were similar as describe
above. MS data were collected by electron impact, in full scan
mode between 5 and 25 min of the GC run, in the positive ion
mode over a mass range of 50–400 Da. The temperature of the
ion source was 250 C. The auto-tune function was used to
optimize the MS settings.
4.8. Calculation of the molar proportions and the weight percentages
The molar proportions of the four phenolic compounds were
calculated by dividing the molar equivalents of the individual compounds
by the total molar equivalents. The molar equivalents were
determined by multiplying the molar extinction coefficients (Table
1) by the peak area under the RP-HPLC profiles of fully saponified
lignan macromolecule (chromatograms not shown). The weight
percentages were calculated based on the measured value for
HMGA and the molar proportions of the phenolic constituents.
4.9. MALDI-TOF MS of lignan macromolecule
For the determination of the molecular mass distribution, unsaponified
lignan macromolecule was analyzed on a Ultraflex MALDI-
TOF MS (Bruker Daltronics GmbH). As matrix 2,5-
dihydroxybenzoic acid dissolved in 50% aq. ACN (15 mg/ml) was
used. Two ll of sample mixture consisting of 10 ll 2 mg/ml unsaponified
lignan macromolecule cleaned over SPE, 10 ll matrixsolution,
and 1 ll 1 mM NaOAc pH 5.0 was spotted on a gold plate.
The MALDI-TOF MS was calibrated with a mixture of maltodextrins
(mass range 365–4092 Da). The system was used in the positive
reflector mode.
