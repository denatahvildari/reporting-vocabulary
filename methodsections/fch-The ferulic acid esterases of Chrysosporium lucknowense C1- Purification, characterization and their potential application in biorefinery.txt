2. Methods
2.1. Materials
Methyl caffeate, methyl coumarate, methyl sinapinate and methyl ferulate
were obtained from Apin Chemicals Ltd. (Abingdon, Oxon, UK). Alcohol insoluble
solids of Brewers spent grain (BSG), corn cobs (CC) and wheat bran (WB) were
present in the laboratory [15]. The following commercial enzyme preparations
were used: Rapidase® Liq+ (Liq+; DSM, Delft, the Netherlands), Driselase® (Dri;
Sigma–Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), Pectinex® Ultra SP (USP; Novozymes, Bagsværd,
Denmark) and RocksoftTM MPL (MPL; Dyadic® Netherlands, Wageningen, The
Netherlands).
Cell free fermentation supernatants of ferulic acid esterase overexpression lines
were obtained from Dyadic®. Overexpression of the genes was performed using
the C1 production platform [16,17]. The ferulic acid esterase candidate genes were
identified based on a sequence homology screen with already identified ferulic
acid esterases and they were named FaeA1, FaeA2 and FaeB2 (Table 1). Due to
a lack of biochemical data for the best hits, the second best hit was used for
annotation.
2.2. Preparation and isolation of feruloylated oligomers
A fraction of corn fibre arabinoxylan oligosaccharides, that contains monomeric,
dimeric and trimeric ferulic acid constituents linked to the oligosaccharides was
used ([4], subfraction M-5). Feruloylated oligosaccharides from sugar beet pulp
were obtained from 5 g pretreated sugar beet pulp ([18], 140-0 supernatant fraction)
digested with the C1 enzymes Abn1, Abn4 and Gal1 [14,19]. The feruloylated
oligomers were isolated and fractionated by reverse phase solid phase extraction
[4]. Samples were eluted with 10 v/v%, 60 v/v% and 100% methanol. Methanol was
removed from the fractions by evaporation in a vacuum rotation evaporator and the
fractions were subsequently freeze-dried. The 60 v/v% methanol fraction contained
all the ferulic acid, as confirmed by UV spectroscopy at 325 nm (see Section 2.4.2).
2.3. Enzyme purification
The purification of the enzymes required a single chromatographic step for
FaeA1 and two chromatographic steps for FaeA2 and FaeB2. Ferulic acid esterase
activity in the purified fractions was monitored by measuring the activity toward
methyl ferulate.
2.3.1. FaeA1
FaeA1 was purified by size exclusion chromatography using an ÄKTApurifier 10
analytical system (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) equipped with a SuperdexTM 75
analytical column (10/300 GL, 1 column volume (CV) = 23.56 ml; GE Healthcare) at a
flow rate of 0.5 ml/min at 20 ◦C. The sample was manually injected via a 200 l
sample loop and eluted with 50 mM NaCl in 50 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH
5.0). Fractions of 200 l were collected in microtiter plates using an ÄKTA Frac-950
fraction collector (GE Healthcare).
2.3.2. FaeA2 and FeaB2
FaeA2 and FaeB2 were purified by hydrophobic interaction chromatography
followed by anion exchange chromatography using an ÄKTAexplorer 100 preparative
system (GE Healthcare). The system was equipped with a self-packed Phenyl
SepharoseTM HP column (XK16, 58 ml column volume; GE Healthcare) that was
equilibrated with 5 CV of 10 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) containing 1.5 M
ammonium sulfate (buffer A). The samples (17.5 ml) were mixed 1:1 with 20 mM
sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) containing 3 M ammonium sulfate. They were cooled
on ice for 30 min and subsequently centrifuged (5 min, 5000
°øg, 4 ◦C). The supernatants
were injected onto the column via a sample pump at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. The samples were eluted at a flow rate of 10 ml/min at 20 ◦C with 10 mM sodium
sulfate buffer (buffer B, pH 5.0): 3 CV 0% B, 2 CV 0–30% linear B, 28 CV 30–100% linear
B, 5 CV 100% B, 5 CV 0% B (equilibration). Fractions (20 ml) were collected in glass
tubes cooled on ice using an ÄKTA Frac-900 fraction collector.
Active fractions (FaeA2: 29.3–33.2 CV, FaeB2: 32.5–34.9 CV) were pooled and
extensively dialyzed (2
°ø
24 h, 4 ◦C) against 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH
6.5) using 12–14 kDa cut-off Visking dialysis tubings (Medicell International Ltd.,
London, UK). The dialyzed fractions were further purified using a self-packed Q
SepharoseTM anion exchange column (XK26, V = 53 ml, GE Healthcare). Samples
were eluted with 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) containing 1 M sodium
chloride (buffer B) using a linear elution profile: 2 CV 0% B, 20 CV 0–50% linear B
(22 CV for FaeB2), 1 CV 50–100% linear B, 2 CV 100% B, 5 CV 0% B (equilibration).
Active fractions (FaeA2: 7.4–8.9 CV, FaeB2: 13.2–14.3 CV) were pooled and dialyzed
against 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) containing 50 mM sodium chloride
(10–12 kDa cut-off, 24 h, 4 ◦C).
2.4. Enzyme characterization
All activity assays toward synthetic substrates are based on the absorption
difference of the free acid and the methyl ester (total concentration: 50 M) at
335
°æ
5 nm [9]. Suitable enzyme concentrations (in stock) were 730 g/ml (FaeA1),
78 g/ml (FaeA2) and 36 g/ml (FaeB2). Sodium-dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and isoelectric focusing were performed as described
previously [19].
2.4.1. Activity toward hydroxycinnamic acid methyl esters
Activities toward the synthetic substrates methyl caffeate, methyl coumarate,
methyl ferulate and methyl sinapinate were determined by incubating 10 l of
enzyme in a total volume of 200 l with 50 M synthetic substrate in 10 mM
BIS–TRIS–HCl buffer (pH 7.0) containing 50 mM sodium chloride. The reaction took
place at 25 ◦C for up to 2 h in a microtiter plate reader (Tecan infinite F500, Gördig,
Austria). The absorbance was measured in 2 min intervals at 340 nm and the activity
was determined by calibration curves of the substrates/products (Fig. 2).
2.4.2. Biochemical properties
The pH optimum of the enzymes was measured in the range from pH 4 to 8
using methyl ferulate as substrate. Therefore, 10 l enzyme was incubated at 25 ◦C
in a final volume of 200 l with 50 M methyl ferulate in McIlvaine buffers (40 mM
disodium hydrogenphosphate mixed with 20 mM citric acid to give the desired
pH). Reaction conditions and quantification were as described in Activities toward
synthetic substrates.
Temperature optima were determined using methyl ferulate (50 M) as substrate
at optimal pH values (FaeA1 and FaeB2: 10 mM BIS–TRIS–HCl buffer (pH 7.0)
containing 50 mM sodium chloride, FaeA2: 10 mM TRIS–HCl (pH 7.5) containing
50 mM sodium chloride).The reaction mixture (990 l substrate in buffer) was put
into a quarz cuvette (1 ml), which was equilibrated at the desired temperature in an
UV-1601 photospectrometer equipped with CPS-240A temperature controlled cell
positioner (Shimadzu Ltd., Kyoto, Japan). After 15 min, 10 l of enzyme was added
and the sample was mixed by inversion. UV–visible spectra were recorded in the
range of 600–200 nm (2 nm resolution) in 2 min intervals over a period of 2 h. The

linear range of the time curves of the UV absorption at 336 nm was used to determine
the enzyme activities.
2.4.3. Activity toward natural substrates
All samples were incubated for 24 h in 50 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) at
35 ◦C. The hydrolyses were stopped by boiling at 100 ◦C for 10 min. Alcohol insoluble
solids of brewers spent grain (BSG), corn cobs (CC), wheat bran (WB) and
sugar beet pulp (SBP) were used as polymeric substrates (5 ml/ml). BSG, CC and
WB were first incubated with Aspergillus awamori endoxylanases I (xyl-I, GH family
10) or III (xyl-III, GH family 11), both purified according to [20]. SBP (1 g in 100 ml)
was digested with Liq+, Dri, USP and MPL. The supernatants obtained after centrifugation
(10 min, 10, 000
°ø
g, 25 ◦C) were used for ferulic acid esterase activity
experiments. All samples were diluted in order to have the same concentrations of
ferulic acid constituents. The ferulic acid assays were performed in 50 mM MOPS
buffer (pH 7.0) at 35 ◦C. The amount of FAE was the same in each experiment (1 g
enzyme/microtiterplate well = 1 g enzyme/0.3 a.u.). The release of ferulic acid was
followed by measuring the absorbance decrease at 340 nm using a microtiterplate
reader (Tecan). The release was quantified as described elsewhere [3].
2.5. Hydroxycinnamic acid release from natural substrates
Arabinoxylan oligomers purified from pretreated corn fibre (CF) and sugar beet
pectin oligomers (1 mg/ml each) were incubated with ferulic acid esterases in water
at 35 ◦C for 16 h. The samples were boiled to inactivate the enzymes and centrifuged
at room temperature (10 min, 10,000
°ø
g). Hydroxycinnamic acid release from natural
substrates was measured by RP-UHPLC-MS analysis in negative ion mode as
described earlier [4] on an Accela UHPLC system (Thermo Scientific) equipped with
a Hypersyl GOLD column (2.1 mm
°ø
150 mm, 1.9 m particle size; Thermo Scientific).
Elution was monitored with the built-in polydiode array multi-wavelength
detector set at 325 nm. The samples were diluted 5 times and 10 l were injected.
Ferulic acid release was quantified with the help of a ferulic acid calibration curve
(1.25, 5.00, 12.50, 25.00 g/ml ferulic acid).
The total amount of ester-linked ferulic acid in corn and sugar beet oligomers
was determined after alkaline hydrolysis and ethylether extraction using the UHPLC
method described above.
