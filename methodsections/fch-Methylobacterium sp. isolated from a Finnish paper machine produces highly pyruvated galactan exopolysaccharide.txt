 2. Experimental
2.1. Isolation of bacterial species and extraction and
purification of the EPS produced
The bacterial species Methylobacterium sp. VTT-E-
11929 was isolated from a slime sample obtained from
a Finnish cardboard producing paper machine. After
isolation and purification of the strain the EPS was
produced in laboratory scale. The EPS was produced
using shale flasks at 30 8C in a medium containing
glucose (20 g/L), yeast extract (0.5 g/L), (NH4)2SO4 (0.6
g/L), KH2PO4 (3.18 g/L), K2HPO4 (5.2 g/L), MgSO4 /7
H2O (0.3 g/L), CaCl2 (0.05 g/L), ZnSO4 /7 H2O (0.2 mg/
L), CuSO4 /5 H2O (0.2 mg/L), MnSO4 /H2O (0.2 mg/L),
FeSO4 /7 H2O (0.6 mg/L) and CoCl2 (0.2 mg/mL) at pH
7.
After cultivation 0.9% NaCl was added to the
medium and the medium was slightly homogenised
and centrifuged (14,687g, 45 min). Ethanol (75% (v/v))
was added to the supernatant to precipitate the EPS
material. The precipitate was solubilised in water and
incubated with protease (Neutrase 0,5L, Novozymes,
Denmark) for 1 h at 37 8C, re-precipitated, dialysed
(Medicell Visking, MWCO 12/14,000 Da) and freezedried.
 2.2. Protein content
Protein content was measured using the combustion
(Dumas) method on a Thermo Quest NA 2100 Nitrogen
and Protein Analyzer (Inter Sciences, The Netherlands)
according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The
sample (5/6 mg) was weighed in to a sample cup and
directly analysed using D-methionine as an external
standard. The protein content was calculated using
6.25 as nitrogen to protein conversion factor.
 2.3. HPSEC of the native EPS
The EPS (2 mg) was dissolved in 1 mL of distilled water
and analysed by high performance size exclusion
chromatography (HPSEC) using pullulan for calibration.
HPSEC was performed on a Thermo Quest HPLC
using three TOSOHAAS TSK-Gel columns in series
(6000-, 4000-, 3000PWXL) preceded by an TSK guard
column (40/6 mm). Enzyme digests were analysed
using three TOSOHAAS TSK-Gel columns in series
(4000-, 3000-, 2500PWXL) preceded by an TSK guard
column (40/6 mm). Elution took place at 30 8C using
0.8 mL/min 0.2 M NaNO3 as eluent. Detection was
performed using a Shodex RI 71 refractive index
detector.
 2.4. Sugar composition
The EPS sugar composition was determined using
methanolysis as described by De Ruiter and coworkers.
15 The EPS was treated with 2 M HCl in dry
CH3OH for 16 h at 80 8C, followed by 1 h of 2 M
CF3CO2H (TFA) at 121 8C. The released sugars were
analysed using high performance anion exchange chromatography
(HPAEC) with pulsed amperometric detection
(PAD) as described by Verhoef and coworkers.13
 2.5. Absolute configuration
The absolute configurations of the monosaccharides
present in the EPS were determined as described by  Gerwig and coworkers.16  The GC-FID analyses of the
tri-methylsilated (/ )-2-butyl glycosides was performed
using a Carlo Erba Mega 5160 GC, equipped with a CPSil
5 CB column (25 m/ 0.32 mm, Chrompack). The
temperature programme was: 80/ 135 8 C at 20 8 C/min;
135/ 220 8 C at 2 8 C/min. The injection port and detector
temperatures were 200 and 250 8 C, respectiv ely. The
Helium flow rate was 3 mL/min and the samples
(approx. 0.5 m L) were injected directly on the column
without a stream splitter.
2.6. Sugar linkage analyses
 The EPS sample was methylated according to Hakomori
17 and subsequently dialysed against water and
ev aporated in a stream of dry air. The methylated
samples were hydrolysed using 2 M TFA (2 h, 121 8 C).
After ev aporation in a stream of air (TB/ 20 8 C), the
partially methylated sample was conv erted to alditol
acetates and analysed by GC-FID.18  Identification of
the compound was performed using GC/ MS as described
by v an Casteren and coworkers.19
2.7. Determination of the pyruvate content
 The amount of pyruv ate was determined using a method
reported by Troyano and coworkers.20  The EPSs (1 mg)
were dissolv ed in 1 mL of 1 M TFA and hydrolysed for
6 h at 120 8 C. The hydrolysate was centrifuged and
analysed at 40 8 C using a Termo Quest HPLC system
equipped with both a Shodex RI71 refractiv e index
detector and a Spectra Physics UV2000 UV detector at
220 nm. HPLC separation was performed using a Bio-
Rad Aminex HPX-87H column using 0.6 mL/min 0.01
M H2 SO4  as a mobile phase. The amount of pyruv ate
was calculated using a calibration curv e of 0.2/ 2 mM
pyruv ic acid.
2.8. Partial hydrolyses of the native EPS
 Since enzymes are known to facilitate the recognition of
repeating units, enzyme-producing bacterial cultures
were enriched from compost heap samples by using
the EPS produced by Methylobacterium  as the only
carbon source. Culture filtrate from an enrichment
culture showing clear reduction of EPS v iscosity was
used as a crude enzyme preparation to incubate with the
EPS in order to obtain oligomers preferably on a
repeating unit lev el. The EPS (1 mg/mL 50 mM NaOAc
buffer) was incubated 50 m L/mL culture filtrate at 30 8 C
for 15 h in an incubation shaker. The reaction was
stopped by keeping the solution at 100 8 C for 15 min,
the sample was centrifuged before analysis. The released  oligomers were analysed using MALDI-TOF MS and
HPSEC as described by Verhoef and coworkers.13
2.9. Auto hydrolyses
 Auto hydrolysis was used to remov e pyruv ate from the
polysaccharide backbone. The nativ e EPS (40 mg) was
dissolv ed in 40 mL water and brought to its H  form
using Amberlite IR 50 ion exchange resin. A suspension
of the polysaccharide solution and Amberlite IR 50 was
stirred for 0.5 h at 25 8 C. After filtering of the Amberlite
the EPS solution was stirred at 100 8 C under reflux for
18 h. The depyruv ated EPS was dialysed against water
for 24 h and freeze-dried.
2.10. FT-IR
 The EPS (1 mg/mL) was dried on a crystal and the
absorption spectrum between 750 and 4000 cm1  was
taken using attenuated total reflectance on a BIO-RAD
FTS 6000 FT-IR spectrometer.
2.11. 13C and 1H NMR
 Prior to NMR analyses, the samples were exchanged in
99.96% D2 O (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, USA)
and after freeze-drying dissolv ed in 99.996% D2 O
(Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, USA). NMR spectra
were recorded at a probe temperature of 70 8 C on a
Bruker AMX-500 spectrometer located at the Wageningen
NMR Centre. Chemical shifts were expressed in
ppm relativ e to internal acetone: 2.225 ppm for 1 H and
31.55 ppm for 13 C. The 1D 1 H proton spectra were
recorded at 500.13 MHz using 64 scans of 8192 data
points and a sweep width of 3000 Hz. The 2D COSY
spectrum was acquired using the double quantum
filtered (DQF) method with a standard pulse sequence
deliv ered by Bruker. 2D TOCSY spectra were acquired
using standard Bruker pulse sequences with 110 ms
mixing time. For all homonuclear 2D spectra 512
experiments of 2048 data points were recorded using
16/ 64 scans per increment. For the 2D HMBC spectrum
21  a standard gradient enhanced 2D-HMQC pulse
sequence deliv ered Bruker was changed into a HMBC
sequence by setting the delay between the first proton
and carbon pulse to 50 ms. For the HMBC experiment
1024 experiments of 2048 data points were performed
with 128 scans per increment.
