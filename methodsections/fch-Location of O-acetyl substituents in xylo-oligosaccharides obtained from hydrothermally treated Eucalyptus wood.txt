 3. Experimental
3.1. Acetylated xylo-oligosaccharides
The neutral acetylated XOS (AcXOS) were obtained as
described previously.5
 3.2. Size-exclusion chromatography
To fractionate the AcXOS-mixture (163 mg in 2 mL) a
Pharmacia system equipped with a BioGel P-2 column
(900Å~26 mm; 200–400 mesh, Bio-Rad Laboratories)
thermostated at 60 °C was used. Elution was performed
at 0.5 mL/min with water (60 °C) and fractions were
collected every 2 mL. The eluent was detected by a
Shodex RI-72 detector. Four of these size-exclusion
runs were performed to obtain sufficient material of
pool X4Ac.
 3.3. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry
Matrix assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-offlight
mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) was performed
as described before.5
 3.4. Reversed-phase HPLC– mass spectrometry
Reversed-phase HPLC was performed on a HPLC system
(Thermo Separation Products) equipped with a
Thermohypersil Aquasil C18 column ((Keystone Scientific);
4.6 mm IDÅ~150 mm; 3 m) in combination with
a Thermohypersil Aquasil C18 guard column (4.6 mm
IDÅ~10 mm; 3 m). The RP-column was coupled to a
splitter (Dionex) directing 10% of the eluent to a Sedex
55 evaporating light scattering detector (Sedere), 5% to
a LCQ Ion-trap (Finnigan MAT 95) and the remaining
part to a fraction collector or waste. Elution (0.8 mL/
min) was performed using a gradient of degassed
(Membrane degasser; Thermo Separation Products)
methanol in pure water: 0–28 v/v% methanol in 0–70
min. Each elution was followed by a equilibration step
(isocratic pure water; 30 min). Pool X4Ac (20 mg/mL)
was subjected to RP chromatography separated in 20
RP-HPLC runs (20 times 100 L of injection) to obtain
enough material of each peak to perform NMR analysis.
Fractions (276 L) were collected by using a fraction
collector in the same series of tubes for 5 runs.
Finally, all tubes containing similar material were
combined.
MS analysis was carried out in the positive mode
using a spray voltage of 5.5 kV and a capillary temperature
of 200 °C. The capillary voltage was set at 42 kV
and the tube lens voltage at 20 kV. MSn was performed
using a window of 1.5–2 m/z and a 35–40% relative
collision energy. The apparatus and the data were
controlled by Xcalibur software. The accuracy of the
mass determinations is 0.3 Da.
 3.5. NMR spectroscopy
Samples were exchanged in D2O (99.9 atom% D, Cambridge
Isotope Laboratories) with intermediate freeze
drying, dissolved in 190 L 99.96% D2O (Cambridge
Isotope Laboratories) and inserted in NMR Shigemimicrotubes.
NMR spectra were recorded at a probe
temperature of 25 °C on a Bruker AMX-500 spectrometer
located at the Wageningen NMR Centre. 1H chemical
shifts are expressed in ppm relative to internal
acetone ( 2.225). 1D 1H NMR spectra were recorded
at 500.13 MHz using 64 scans of 8192 data points and
a sweep width of 3000 Hz. The 2D COSY spectra were
acquired using the double quantum filtered (DQF)
method with a standard pulse sequence delivered by
Bruker. The 2D TOCSY spectra were acquired using
standard Bruker pulse sequences with a mixing time of
100 ms. For these 2D 1H spectra 512 experiments of
2048 data points were recorded using 32 scans per
increment.
 3.6. Reversed-phase HPLC– NMR
Reversed-phase HPLC–NMR was performed on a
HPLC system (Bruker) equipped with a Thermohypersil
Aquasil C18 column (4.6 mm IDÅ~150 mm; 3 m)
in combination with a Thermohypersil (Keystone Scientific)
Aquasil C18 guard column (4.6 mm IDÅ~10 mm;
3 m). Furthermore, the HPLC system was connected
to a Bruker peak sampling unit (BPSU; Bruker) following
UV detection (205–215 nm; Bruker). Elution (0.8
mL/min) was performed using a gradient of degassed
(Membrane degasser; Bruker) methanol in D2O: 0–16
v/v% methanol in 0–40 min. Samples containing
mainly X4Ac (10 mg/mL) or X3Ac (15 mg/mL),  obtained by size-exclusion chromatography, were applied
to RP-HPLC– NMR (100  L/ run). Each elution
was followed by a equilibration step (isocratic D2 O; 30
min). Samples were transported one by one from the
BPSU to the NMR probe, using the same ratio of
D2 O/ methanol as was necessary for the particular
oligomers to elute from the RP-column.
NMR spectra were recorded at a probe temperature
of 25 ° C on a Bruker DPX-400 spectrometer located at
the Wageningen NMR Centre. Solvent signals were
suppressed with double presaturation using Bruker
LC– NMR software. 1 H chemical shifts are expressed in
ppm relative to methanol (  3.34). 1D 1 H NMR spectra
were recorded at 400 MHz using up to 2000 scans of
32,768 data points and a sweep width of 8000 Hz. The
2D TOCSY spectrum was acquired using a standard
Bruker pulse sequence. 496 experiments of 2048 data
points were recorded using 240 scans per increment
resulting in a measuring time of 66 h. The mixing time
was 65 ms.
