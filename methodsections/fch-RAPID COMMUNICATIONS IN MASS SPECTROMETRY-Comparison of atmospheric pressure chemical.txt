EXPERIMENTAL
Extraction of lignans from sesame seed
Sesame seeds were milled followed by Soxhlet defatting with
hexane (0.3 g meal/mL hexane). After evaporation of the
hexane, sesame oil and defatted sesame meal were obtained.
In order to extract the lignans from the oil, oil was
extracted with methanol (0.2 g oil/mL MeOH) at 908C for
30 min. The oil was solidified at 208C and centrifuged to
separate the methanolic extract from the oil. Water was
added to the methanolic extract to a concentration of 40% (v/v),
and residual oil was removed by liquid–liquid extraction Rapidase Liq.) was extracted with 20mL MeOH. The pellet
and the extract were separated by centrifugation (30 min,
28100 g, 48C).
Fermentation of acid-pretreated aglyconic
lignans from sesame seeds
The lignan extract from oil and the deglucosylated lignans
from defatted meal were acid-treated prior to fermentation.
Lignans from oil (5600 mg) were dissolved in 60mL 0.5M
methanolic HCl. Deglucosylated lignans (370 mg) were
treated with 60mL 0.05M methanolic HCl. After incubation
for 1 h at 858C, the reaction was stopped by neutralizing the
samples with NaOH while cooling on ice. The treated lignans
from oil and the treated deglucosylated lignans were
combined, MeOH was evaporated and the acid-treated lignan
mixture was redissolved in 20mL 20% (v/v) aqueous MeOH.
Fermentation media were prepared containing 40mL
brain hart infusion broth (BHI; Becton, Dickinson Co., Le
Pont de Claix, France) (40 g/L) plus 5mL acid-treated lignan
mixture. Blanks were prepared accordingly. All media were
flushed with nitrogen. To these media fecal slurry (5 mL) was
added. This fecal slurry consisted of 5 g of feces from five
healthy volunteers each diluted to a 5% (w/v) solution,
filtered and made anaerobic by flushing with nitrogen.
The cultures were incubated at 378C. At several time points
samples (1 mL) were taken. Lignans were extracted by
liquid–liquid partitioning with EA (1:3, v/v). After evaporation
of the EA, the samples were redissolved in 0.5mL
MeOH and analyzed by reversed-phase high-performance
liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC)/MS.
Analysis of the lignan extracts by RP-HPLC
Aglyconic lignans were, prior to RP-HPLC analysis, treated
with liquid–liquid partitioning with EA and resolubilized in
MeOH, as mentioned above. Commercial sesamin was
obtained from Sigma. Glycosidic lignans were cleaned by
solid-phase extraction (SPE). SepPak Vac C18 cartridges
(20 cc/5 g; Waters, Milford, MA, USA) were activated with
successively 2 column volumes MeOH and 2 column
volumes water. A sample of lignan glucosides (2 mg/
mL) in water was loaded and the cartridge was washed with
1 column volume of water. Lignan glycosides were eluted by
3 column volumes of MeOH of which the first one was
discarded. The MeOH was evaporated to a final volume of
1 mL.
Samples were analyzed on a HPLC system from Thermo
Separation Products (Waltham, MA, USA) equipped with a
membrane degasser, P4000 pump, AS3000 autosampler, and
a UV3000 detector. Samples of 20 mL were injected onto a
Waters XTerra C18MScolumn (4.6150mm, 3.5 mmparticle
size) with a guard column (XTerra C18 MS, 4.610 mm,
3.5mm particle size; Waters, Milford, MA, USA). Water and
acetonitrile (ACN), both acidified with 0.1% (v/v) acetic acid,
were used as eluents. The flow rate was 0.7 mL/min, and the
eluate was monitored at 280 nm. The flowing gradient used
was: 0–30 min, linear from 10%–50% (v/v) ACN; 30–45 min,
linear from 50%–100% ACN; 45–50 min, isocratic on 100%
ACN; 50–55 min, linear from 100%–10% ACN; 55–60 min,
isocratic on 10% ACN.
ESI-MS and APCI-MS
Mass spectrometric data were obtained by analyzing
samples on an LCQ Classic ion trap mass spectrometer
(ThermoFinnigan, Waltham, MA, USA) coupled on-line to
the RP-HPLC system (see above) equipped with an ESI or
APCI probe. In the case of ESI-MS, 1/10 of the flow from the
RP-HPLC system was directed to the mass spectrometer. In
the case of APCI-MS, the total flow was used. Helium was
used as the sheath gas and nitrogen as the auxiliary gas. Data
were collected over an m/z range of 150–2000. Datadependent
MS2 analysis was performed with a normalized
collision energy of 27%. Most settings were optimized using
’tune plus’ (Xcalibur, Thermo Finnigan) via the automatic
and semi-automatic tuning. The capillary temperature,
source heater temperature (only APCI), and source voltage
were manually adjusted.
For ESI-MS, the system was tuned with secoisolarisirecinol
diglucoside (SDG) and SECO, the SDG aglycon, both in the
positive and in the negative ionization mode (SDG positive:
capillary temperature (CT).2708C, source voltage (SV).
5 kV; SDG negative: CT.2708C, SV.4.5 kV; SECO positive:
CT.1508C, SV.6.0 kV: SECO negative: CT.2008C,
SV.4.5 kV).
For APCI-MS, the system was tuned with SDG and SECO
in the negative ion mode, and with SECO and sesamin in the
positive ion mode. (In all cases, the source voltage was 5 kV;
SDG negative: source heater temperature (SHT).4508C,
CT.2008C; SECO negative: SHT.4508C, CT.2008C; SECO
positive: SHT.2008C, CT.1508C; sesamin positive: SHT.
1508C, CT.2508C.)
For comparison, all samples were analyzed using four
optimized methods for ESI-MS and four optimized methods
for APCI-MS.
