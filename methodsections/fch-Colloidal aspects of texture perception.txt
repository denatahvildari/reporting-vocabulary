 2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
Potato, soybean, onion, and citrus arabinogalactan were
obtained as described by Van de Vis.8 The endo-galactanase
from Aspergillus niger was purified by Van de
Vis et al.12 The b-D-Galp-(1!4)-specific b-galactosidase
from Bifidobacterium adolescentis DSM 20083 was
cloned and purified by Hinz et al.13 A b-(1!4)-galacto-
disaccharide standard was purchased from Megazyme
International Ireland Ltd. (Bray, Ireland).
 2.2. Enzymatic degradation of potato arabinogalactan
A solution of 100 mg/mL potato arabinogalactan in
10 mM NaOAc buffer pH 5 was partially digested
with an endo-galactanase from A. niger (26.4 lg,
26 U) for 384 h at 30 C, while continuously being
mixed. The incubation was stopped by heating for
10 min at 100 C and insoluble material was removed
by centrifugation (5 min at 10,000g). The extent of
the depolymerization was followed by high-performance
anion-exchange chromatography (HPAEC) and
high-performance size-exclusion chromatography
(HPSEC).
 2.3. Fractionation of arabinogalacto-oligosaccharides
The arabinogalacto-oligosaccharides were separated
from the polymeric material by fractionation on a
Bio-Rad Bio-Gel P2 (200–400 mesh, Richmond, CA,
USA) size-exclusion column (100 · 2.6 cm), using an
Amersham Biotech Hiload system (Uppsala, Sweden).
Components were eluted with Millipore water at
60 C (flow rate was 0.5 mL/min) and monitored by
refractive index detection using a Shodex RI-72 detector
(Tokyo, Japan). Fractions (5 mL) were collected
and appropriate fractions were pooled as indicated in
Figure 2.
 2.4. Analysis of sugar composition
The sugar composition of the various Bio-Gel P2 pools
was determined using methanolysis according to De
Ruiter et al.14 For this, the different pools were treated
with 2 M HCl in dry methanol for 16 h at 80 C, followed
by 1 h of 2 M TFA at 121 C. The sugars released
were quantified using HPAEC.
 2.5. Enzymatic degradation of arabinogalactooligosaccharides
Bio-Gel P2 pools III, IV, and V were incubated with
0.015 U of the b-galactosidase b-Gal II from B. adolescentis.
The incubations were carried out in 20 mM
phosphate buffer, pH 6 at 37 C for 60 min, and stopped
by heating for 10 min at 100 C. Insoluble material was
removed by centrifuging (10 min at 10,000g). The reaction
products were analyzed by HPAEC.
 2.6. Complete enzymatic depolymerization of
arabinogalactans
A solution of 1 mg/mL arabinogalactan in 50 mM
NaOAc buffer pH 5 was incubated with the endo-galactanase
from A. niger (0.14 lg, 0.26 U) for 24 h at 30 C,
under continuous stirring. The total volume of the incubation
was 100 lL. The incubation was stopped by heating
for 10 min at 100 C, and insoluble material was
removed by centrifugation (10 min at 10,000g). The
incubation was monitored by HPAEC.
 2.7. Estimation of the b -(1! 3)/b -(1! 4)-ratio in arabinogalactan
from different sources
The products from the complete enzymatic depolymerization
of arabinogalactans (50 lL) were incubated with
the b-galactosidase b-Gal II from B. adolescentis
(0.15 lg, 0.012 U). The volume of the reaction mixtures
was adjusted to 100 lL with 20 mM phosphate buffer
pH 6, and incubated at 37 C for 60 min. The incubations
were stopped by heating for 10 min at 100 C,
and insoluble material was removed by centrifuging
(10 min at 10,000g). Reaction products were determined
by HPAEC analysis.
 2.8. Analytical methods
High-performance size-exclusion chromatography was
performed on three TSKgel columns (7.8 mm
ID · 30 cm per column) in series (G4000 PWXL,
G3000 PWXL, G2500 PWXL; Tosohaas, Stuttgart,
Germany), in combination with a PWX-guard column
(Tosohaas, Stuttgart, Germany). Elution took place at
30 C with 0.2 Msodium nitrate at 0.8 mL/min. The eluate
was monitored by refractive index detection using a
Shodex RI-72 detector. Calibration was performed
using dextrans.
High-performance anion-exchange chromatography
was performed on a Thermo-Quest HPLC system
equipped with a Dionex CarboPac PA-1 (4 mm
ID · 250 mm) column in combination with a Dionex
CarboPac PA guard column (3 mm ID · 25 mm) and a
Dionex ED40 PAD-detector (Dionex Co., Sunnyvale,
USA). A flow rate of 1 mL/min was used.
Arabinogalacto-oligosaccharides were determined
using a gradient of sodium acetate in 100 mM NaOH:
0–40 min, 0–400 mM NaOAc in 100 mM NaOH; 40–
41 min, 400–1000 mM NaOAc in 100 mM NaOH;
41–46 min, 1000 mM NaOAc in 100 mM NaOH; 46–
60 min, 100 mM NaOH.  The determination of the sugar composition was performed
using the same HPAEC system equipped with a
Dionex CarboPac PA20 (3 mm ID ·  150 mm) in combination
with CarboPac PA20 guard column (3 mm
ID ·  30 mm) and Borate trap (4 mm ID ·  50 mm) and
separated at 0.5 mL/min by isocratic elution with
3 mM NaOH for 20 min followed by applying a linear
gradient from 0 to 700 mM NaOH in 20 min.
2.9. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry
 For MALDI-TOF MS (matrix-assisted laser desorption/
ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry) an
Ultraflex workstation (Bruker Daltronics GmbH, Germany)
was used. The mass spectrometer was calibrated
with a mixture of malto-dextrins (mass range 365–
2309). The samples were mixed with a matrix solution
(1 l L each). The matrix solution was prepared by dissolving
9 mg of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid and 3 mg
1-hydroxyisoquinoline in a 1 mL mixture of acetonitrile/
water (300 l L:700 l L). Two microliters of the prepared
sample and matrix solutions were put on a gold plate
and dried with warm air.
2.10. 13C and 1H NMR
 Prior to NMR analyses, the samples were exchanged in
99.96% D2 O (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, USA)
and after freeze-drying dissolved in 99.996% D2 O (Cambridge
Isotope Laboratories, USA). NMR spectra were
recorded at a probe temperature of 25  C on a Bruker
AMX-500 spectrometer located at the Wageningen
NMR Centre. Chemical shifts were expressed in parts
per million relative to internal acetone: d  = 2.225 ppm
for 1 H and d  = 31.55 ppm for 13 C.
The 1D 1 H proton spectra were recorded at
500.13 MHz using eight scans of 8192 data points and
a sweep width of 3000 Hz. The 1D 13 C proton decoupled
carbon spectra were recorded at 125.77 Hz using
100,000 scans of 32,768 data points and a sweep width
of 31,250 Hz.
The 2D COSY spectra were acquired using the double
quantum filtered (DQF) method with a standard pulse
sequence delivered by Bruker.
2D TOCSY spectra were acquired using a standard
Bruker pulse sequences with 110 ms mixing time, respectively.
For all homonuclear 2D spectra, 512 experiments
of 2048 data points were recorded using 32 scans per
increment.
For the 2D HMBC spectrum15  a standard gradient
enhanced 2D HMQC pulse sequence delivered Bruker
was changed into a HMBC sequence by setting the
delay between the first proton and carbon pulse to
50 ms. For the HMBC experiment, 1024 experiments
of 2048 data points were recorded with 128 scans per
increment.
