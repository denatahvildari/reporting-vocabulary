Materials and methods
Sample materials
Three different nylon 12 films were used. Two were
commercial sausage casings, the third material used
in this study originated from an EU project for the
development of a reference material for specific
migration testing (StoÅN rmer 2002).
. Film A: nylon 12 monofilm, sausage casing, 39 mm
thickness.
. Film B: bilayer sausage casing, 29 mm nylon 12,
19 mm nylon 6, 40 mm thickness.
. Film C: PA12 monofilm, certified reference material
candidate, 196 mm thickness.
Reagents
All reagents and solvents were of analytical quality
unless specified otherwise: water and methanol
were HPLC grade from Fluka, Bucks, Switzerland.
Olive oil was from Minerva, Voghera, Italy. The
azeotropic mixture of ethyl acetate and cyclohexane
was glass distilled in our laboratories. Nylon 12 dimer
and trimer standards were produced in-house. Details
are described by Stoffers (2003). Apparatus
LC/MS. A Thermo Finnigan LCQ Deca (ion trap)
applying atmospheric pressure chemical ionization
(APCI, Vaporizer Temperature: 450C, Corona
current: 5.0 mA, heated capillary: 225C) was used.
Detection in full scan mode (m/z.100–1000), the
following mass traces were used for quantification:
laurolactam m/z.198.2, dimer m/z.395.4, trimer:
m/z.592.6. A Hypersil ODS5 with 1254mm i.d.
and 5 mm particle size was used; 0.8 ml min1 total
flow of the mobile phase, injection volume 15 ml.
Quantification by external standards. Isooctane
samples (0.25 ml) and standards were evaporated
using a stream of nitrogen and redissolved in
0.25 ml methanol before injection. Other samples
and standards were directly injected. Gradient: from
30% A (methanol) 70% B (water) for 3 min, to 90%
A in 6 min, held for 6 min, returning in 1 min to 30%
A for 10 min. Retention times were: laurolactam: 8.1,
dimer: 8.9, trimer: 9.9.
Size exclusion chromatography (SEC). Pump:
Gynkotek N480, mobile phase: azeotropic mixture
of ethyl acetate and cyclohexane (56:44, w/w), flow:
3ml min1, column: Pharmacia XK26/40, 26mm i.d.,
bed height 370 mm, filled with Bio-Beads SX-3
swollen in the eluent described above, refraction index
detector: Gynkotek RI SE-51, autosampler: Gilson
Abimed 231XL equipped with a syringe pump 402,
fraction collector: Gilson Abimed 201.
Olive oil sample clean-up. A 0.5 g oil aliquot
was filled up to a total weight of 5 g using the GPC
mobile phase mentioned above. A total of 4ml of this
solution was injected into the SEC. The fraction
containing the oil was determined by injection of
a blank (10% w/w olive oil in eluent), the fraction
containing laurolactam was determined by injection
of a 10 000 mgml1 laurolactam standard in eluent.
The olive oil peak eluted roughly at between 23
and 34 min. The following fraction was completely
collected and analysed as follows: the collected
fraction (approximately 75 ml) was evaporated at
60C and 350 mbar in a rotary evaporator to
about 1 ml, quantitatively transferred into a 10-ml
volumetric flask and dried down using a stream
of nitrogen. The residue was redissolved in 10 ml
methanol and a 15-ml aliquot was injected into
the LC/MS system. For calibration, oil standards
spiked with 0, 1, 5, 10, 25 and 50 mgg1 laurolactam,
respectively, were cleaned-up along with the test
samples. Oligomer concentrations were determined
using response factors determined by injections of
laurolactam, dimer and trimer standards.
Determination of the initial concentration (CP,0)
of laurolactam and oligomers in the polymer
Film samples (1 g) cut into 0.5-cm squares were
weighed accurately into 50-ml Erlenmeyer flasks
(three replicates per film). A total of 25 ml 95%
ethanol was added. The flasks were closed and
stored at 60C for 24 h. 1ml aliquots were transferred
to autosampler vials for analysis. The remaining
solvent was discarded, the film pieces briefly rinsed
with 95% ethanol, the solvent discarded and the film
pieces dried. Then, another 25 ml solvent were filled
into the flasks. A total of 1ml aliquots from the
second extraction were transferred to autosampler
vials for analysis. The samples were analysed by LC
along with external standards. The first extraction
was considered complete if <5% was found in the
second extraction cycle.
Migration experiments Migration experiments
Migration into olive oil, isooctane, 95% ethanol, 50%
ethanol and water. Migration tests were carried out
according to European Standard EN1186 (CEN
1998). The following test conditions were used: olive
oil 2 h/100C; isooctane 1.5 h/60C; 95% ethanol
3.5 h/60C; 50% ethanol 2 h/reflux 90C and water
2 h/reflux 100C.
Overall and specific migrations were determined
by full immersion testing. A total of 1 dm2 film was
folded fan-like so that it could be easily placed into
a cylinder and full contact was ensured. The
contact area was 2 dm2 (1dm2 on both sides), and
the volume used was 100 ml. Before the incubation
period, cylinders and solvents were preheated to the
respective testing temperatures. Film B consisted of
a PA6 side and a PA12 side, therefore only 1 dm2
was considered as contact area. Upon exposure,
1ml aliquots were filled into autosampler vials to
determine specific migration (isooctane samples
after a change of solvents as described above).

Downloaded by The remaining volume was used to determine
overall migration by evaporation of the solvent in a
stainless steel beaker and subsequent gravimetric
determination of the residue (CEN 1998).
Cylinders as described above were also used for
diffusion kinetics experiments. A total of 250-ml
samples of isooctane or 0.5-g samples of olive oil
were taken using a pipette after 1, 2, 4, 8, 24 and 48 h
of incubation. Solvent samples were filled into
autosampler vials and stored at 4C until analysis.
Olive oil samples were diluted 10 times with an
azeotropic mixture of ethyl acetate and cyclohexane
and stored at 4C until analysis.
Kinetic migration modelling
Experimental data were used to estimate the diffusion
coefficient DP, the partitioning coefficient KPF and
the diffusion conductance AP. Numerical integration
of Fick’s second law was applied using the software
Athena Visual Workbench (http://www.athenavisual.
com). The initial and boundary conditions were used
as stated above. The parameters of the model were
estimated using non-linear regression. Parameter output
is given with 95% confidence intervals.
