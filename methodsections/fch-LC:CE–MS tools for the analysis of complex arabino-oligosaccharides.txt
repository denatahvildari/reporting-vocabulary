4. Materials and methods
4.1. Materials
Linear a-(1,5)-linked AOS (DP 2-8) were purchased from
Megazyme International Ltd (Bray, Ireland), and were denoted
2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, and 8.0, respectively. Branched AOS were
isolated from sugar beet arabinan by enzyme digestions with
pure arabino-hydrolases (Abn1, Abn2, and Abn4; Chrysosporium
lucknowense) followed by purification of the branched oligosaccharides.
6 These fractions containing purified AOS were used for
the identification of peaks in the different separation techniques.
An overview of all the linear and branched AOS is given in Table 1.
To produce a suitable sample, two arabinan digests (D-30 and
D-1006) were mixed 1:1 to ensure a complex arabinan enzyme
digest for comparative analysis. This mixture will be referred to
as D-30/100.
4.2. High performance anion-exchange chromatography with
pulsed amperometric detection
An HPAEC system (ICS-3000, Dionex Corporation, Sunnyvale,
CA, USA) was equipped with a CarboPac PA-1 column and a
CarboPac PA-1 guard column (2 mm ID  250 mm and 2 mm
ID  25 mm; Dionex Corporation). A flow of 0.3 mL/min was used
and the temperature was kept at 20 C. AOS (injection volume
10 lL; 10–100 lg/mL) were separated using a gradient with
0.1 M NaOH (solution A) and 1 M NaOAc in 0.1 M NaOH (solution
B): 0–36 min from 0% B to 42% B, 36–42 min at 100% B, and 42–
57 min at 0% B.6
4.3. Porous-graphitized-carbon liquid chromatography with
evaporative light scattering and mass spectrometric detection
PGC-HPLC-ELSD/MS was performed on a Thermo Accela UHPLC
system (Waltham, MA, USA) equipped with a Hypercarb column
(PGC, 100  2.1 mm, 3 lm) in combination with a Hypercarb guard
column (10  2.1 mm; 3 lm, Thermo Electron Corporation). Elution
was performed with a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min and a column
oven temperature of 70 C. The injection volume was set to 10 lL
(0.1–0.4 mg/mL for purified AOS and 5 mg/mL for sugar beet arabinan
digest D30/100). The following eluents were used: Millipore
water (A), acetonitrile (B), and 0.2% (w/v) trifluoroacetic acid
(TFA) in water (C). To all the eluents 25 lM lithium acetate was
added to ensure lithium adduct formation of all components during
the MS analysis. The following elution profile was used: 0–
1 min, isocratic 100% A, 1–15 min, linear gradient from 0% to
27.5% (v/v) B, 15–28 min linear gradient from 27.5% to 60% B,
and concomitant linear gradient from 0% to 10% (v/v) C, 28–
31 min linear gradient from 60% to 80% B, and from 10% to 20%
C, 31–35 min isocratic 80% B and 20% C, 35–36 min from 80% B
and 20% C to 100% A, 36–41 min equilibration with 100% A. The
PGC-column was coupled to a 1:1-splitter (Accurate, Dionex Corporation)
directing the eluent both to an ELSD 85 evaporative light
scattering detector (Sedere, Alfortville, France) and an ESI-MSndetector
(LTQ XL MS, ion trap, Thermo Electron Corporation). The
drift tube temperature of the ELSD was set to 50 C and the gain
to 12. MS-detection was performed in positive mode using a spray
voltage of 4.6 kV and a capillary temperature of 260 C and auto tuned on arabino-tetraose (m/z 553). The ion trap was closed either
after 10 ms or when an intensity of 3  105 was reached to enable
the detection of minor components and to avoid the overload of
the MS by abundant components. The MSn-experiments were performed
using wide band activation and based on dependent scansettings
(Xcalibur software, Thermo Electron Corporation).
For modeling of the 3D-structure of the linear and branched
AOS the software ChemBio Office 2010 (CambridgeSoft Corporation,
Cambridge, MA, USA) was used.
4.4. Capillary electrophoresis with laser-induced fluorescence
detection and MS detection
4.4.1. Labeling of samples and standards
4.4.1.1. CE–LIF analysis. To about 0.1 mg of sample D-30/100 and
20 nmol of each purified AOS 5 nmol maltose was added as internal
standard and mobility marker. These mixtures were dried
using the SpeedVac Concentrator Savant ISS110 (Thermo Electron
Corporation) and subsequently labeled with the fluorescent 9-aminopyrene-
1,4,6-trisulfonate (APTS) for 90 min at 60 C using the
ProteomeLab Carbohydrate Labeling and Analysis Kit (Beckham
Coulter, Fullerton, CA, USA). The derivatized samples (4 lL) were
diluted 500 times prior to CE–LIF analysis.
4.4.1.2. CE–MS analysis. Arabinose and arabinobiose present in
sample D-30/100 were removed prior to CE–MS analysis by solid
phase extraction (SPE) on non-porous-graphitized carbon cartridges
(150 mg; Alltech, Deerfield, IL, USA) as described previously.
11 Two percent acetonitrile in water (v/v) was used to elute
the arabinose and arabinobiose, the oligomers of DP >3 were eluted
with 25% acetonitrile in water (v/v). After air-drying of the 25%
acetonitrile (v/v) fraction, the material was re-dissolved in Millipore
water.
Purified AOS (50 nmol) and the SPE-treated sample D-30/100
(0.1 mg carbohydrate) were labeled as described above. Maltose
(10 nmol) was added as internal standard and mobility marker.
The derivatized samples (4 lL) were diluted 37.5 and 125 times
for the SPE-treated sample D-30/100 and the purified AOS standards,
respectively, prior to CE–LIF-MS analysis.
4.4.2. Capillary electrophoresis with laser-induced fluorescence
detection (CE–LIF)
CE–LIF was performed on a ProteomeLab PA 800 characterization
system (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA, USA), equipped with
an internal laser-induced fluorescence detector (LIF; excitation:
488 nm, emission 520 nm; Beckman Coulter) and a polyvinyl alcohol
(N–CHO)-coated capillary (50 lm ID 50.2 cm (Beckman
Coulter), detector after 40 cm), kept at 25 C. Samples were loaded
hydrodynamically (7 s at 0.5 psi) on the capillary. Separation was
performed in the reversed polarity mode (30 kV, 20 min) in
25 mMacetate buffer (pH 4.75) containing 0.4% polyethylene oxide
as provided in the ProteomeLab Carbohydrate Labeling and Analysis
Kit (Beckham Coulter). Peaks were integrated manually using
Chromeleon software 6.8 (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA, USA).
4.4.3. Capillary electrophoresis with mass spectrometry
(CE–MS)
CE–MS was performed on a P/ACE™ System MDQ (Beckman
Coulter). Opposite to CE–LIF, for CE–MS analysis a fused silica capillary
(50 lm ID 85 cm (Beckman Coulter)) and MS compatible
buffers were used. This CE–MS set-up results in a 5–6 times increase
of the migration time (50–60 min) and a significant loss
of resolution compared to CE-LIF analysis. A capillary window after 60 cm was fitted with an ellipsoid for LIF detection to enable the
monitoring of the elution profile prior to MS analysis. An external
LIF detector was used (excitation: 488 nm, emission: 520 nm; Picometrics
ZetaLIF discovery system; Picometrics, Toulouse, France).
LIF signals were sent to Beckman 32Karat software via an Agilent
SSXL4002 converter (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA).
Separation was performed in the reversed polarity mode (20 kV,
60 min) in 0.3% (v/v) formic acid at a capillary temperature of
15 C. Samples were injected for 2 s at 10 psi.10
The ESI-MS (LTQ, ion trap, Thermo Electron Corporation) was
operated in negative mode using a spray voltage of 2.0 kV and an
MS-capillary temperature of 190 C. The end of the CE capillary
was installed in front of the ESI source by leading it through a Tpart
designed in our laboratory19 and provided the coaxial addition
of a sheath liquid (50/50 isopropanol/water) at 2.5 lL/min via a
5 mL syringe (Hamilton, Reno, NV, USA) coupled to an automated
syringe pump (Pump 11 Pico Plus, Harvard apparatus, Holliston,
MA, USA). Mass spectra were acquired from m/z 300 to 1500.
MSn was performed in the data-dependent mode using a window
of m/z 1 and collision energy of 38%. MSn data were interpreted
using Xcalibur software 2.0.7 (Thermo Electron Corporation). Base
peak chromatograms are shown in their smoothed forms.
