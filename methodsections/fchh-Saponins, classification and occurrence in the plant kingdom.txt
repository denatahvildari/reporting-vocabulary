4.1. Lignan extraction from flaxseed hulls
Flaxseed hulls, kindly provided by Acatris Specialities
Holding B.V. (Giessen, The Netherlands), were defatted
by soxhlet extraction. In order to defat, 400 g of hulls were
extracted with 3 l of n-hexane, resulting in 93.5 g oil
extracted. The lignan macromolecule was extracted from
the defatted hulls by a three-step sequential extraction with
63% (v/v) aq. EtOH. In the first step, 9 ml of aq. EtOH per
gram of defatted flaxseed hulls was used, in the second step
3.6 ml/g and in the last step 2.3 ml/g. The first two extractions
were performed for 4 h at room temperature while
stirring, the last extraction was performed overnight. The
extracts and the hulls were separated by filtration on a
595 round paper filter (Schleicher & Schuell). After evaporation
of the EtOH, the extract was lyophilized yielding
29.9 g of lignan macromolecule.
4.2. Saponification of the lignan macromolecule
Solutions of 2 mg/ml lignan macromolecule in 63% (v/v)
aq. EtOH containing various concentrations NaOH were
(partially) saponified to obtain lignan macromolecular
fragments of various sizes. NaOH concentrations ranging
from 1 to 25 mM NaOH were used for partial saponification.
For full saponification 75 mM NaOH was used.
Saponification was performed at room temperature while
stirring. After 24 h, the reaction was stopped by lowering
the pH to 6.5–7.0 with HOAc (20 mM–1.5 M for analytical
purposes, glacial HOAc for preparative purification purposes).
For analytical purposes, the incubation volume
was 1 ml, for preparative purification purposes a volume
of 2.5 l was used.
4.3. Sample clean up of saponified lignan macromolecule
Low molecular weight polar material was removed from
the (partially) saponified samples by solid phase extraction
(SPE; SepPak Vac, 20 cc/5 g, C18 cartridge, Waters). Prior
to loading samples onto the SPE cartridge, the EtOH concentration
in the reaction mixture was reduced: the 1 ml
samples were diluted with 25 ml water, whereas for the
2.5 l incubations the EtOH was evaporated and the remaining
solution was concentrated further to max. 5 mg/ml.
Insoluble particles formed during concentration, were
removed by centrifugation (28,100g, 4 C, 30 min) and
the supernatant was applied onto the cartridge. Resolubilisation
of the insoluble material in 63% (v/v) aq. EtOH and
analysis of this material on analytical RP-HPLC did not
show any peaks corresponding to peaks annotated as constituents
of the lignan macromolecule (Fig. 3).
After activation of the SepPak cartridge with successively
2 column volumes of MeOH and 2 column volumes
of water, a maximum of 150 mg (partially) saponified lignan
macromolecule (supernatant) was loaded onto the cartridge.
After a wash step with 1 column volume of water,
lignans were eluted from the cartridge with 3 column volumes
of MeOH of which the first column volume was discarded.
For analytical purposes, the MeOH was
evaporated under a stream of air to a final volume of
1 ml. For purification purposes, all MeOH was evaporated
and the (partially) saponified lignans were lyophilized. Aliquots
of the samples were analyzed on analytical RPHPLC.
After full and partial saponification (2 mM NaOH)
of 5.0 g lyophilized lignan macromolecule and sample clean
up, 2.5 g and 2.8 g of fully and partially saponified lignan
macromolecule was obtained, respectively.
4.4. Analytical reversed phase HPLC (RP-HPLC)
Samples were analyzed on an X-Terra C18 MS column
(Waters; 3.5 lm particle size, 4.6 · 150 mm) with an XTerra
C18 MS guard column (Waters; 3.5 lm particle size,
4.6 · 10 mm) run on a Thermo Separation Products HPLC
system equipped with a membrane degasser, P4000 pump,
AS3000 autosampler, and UV3000 detector. Water and
acetonitrile (ACN), both acidified with 0.1% (v/v) HOAc,
were used as eluents. The flow rate was 0.7 ml/min. The following
linear gradient was used: 0–25 min, 10–30% ACN;
25–30 min, 30–50% ACN; 30–40 min, isocratic on 50%
ACN; 40–42 min, 50–100% ACN; 42–47 min, isocratic on
100% ACN; 47–50 min, 100–10% ACN; 50–60 min, isocratic
on 10% ACN. The eluate was monitored at
280 nm. The injection volume was 20 ll. Samples were
injected being solved in the solvent in which they were
extracted or eluted (water, MeOH, 63% (v/v) aq. EtOH
or ACN:water mixtures).
4.5. Preparative reversed phase HPLC
Lignans and fragments of the lignan macromolecule
were purified by preparative RP-HPLC on an X-Terra
C18 MS column (Waters; 5 lm particle size, 50 · 100 mm,
OBD) with an X-Terra C18 MS guard column (Waters;
5 lm particle size, 19 · 10 mm) ran on aWaters preparative
HPLC system equipped with a 2525 pump, 2767 sample
manager, Fluid Organizer and 2996 photodiode array
detector. Water and ACN, both acidified with 0.01%
TFA, were used as eluents. The flow rate was 80 ml/min.
The linear gradient was as follows: 0–16.6 min, 10–30%
ACN; 16.6–20 min, 30–50% ACN; 20–26.6 min, isocratic
on 50% ACN; 26.6–28 min, 50–100% ACN; 28–31.3 min,
isocratic on 100% ACN; 31.3–33.3 min, 100–10% ACN;
33.3–40 min, isocratic on 10% ACN.
Up to 600 mg of lignans (2 mg partially or fully saponified
lignan macromolecule/ml water) were loaded per run.  Prior to loading, the sample was filtered over a 0.2 l m cellulose
acetate filter (Schleicher & Schuell) to remove residual
insoluble particles. Sample was loaded using the Waters
reagent manager with a maximum flow rate of 2 ml/min.
Based on the response at 280 nm, fractions were collected
(leading edge gradient = 5%, peak terminates when valley
= 0). Appropriate fractions were pooled, as were the
corresponding pools from subsequent runs. ACN was evaporated
and the fractions were lyophilized. The purity of the
fractions pooled was determined on analytical HPLC.
4.6. Semi-preparative reversed phase HPLC
 For purification of 100 mg or less lignan macromolecule
constituents, the samples were separated on a semi-preparative
X-Terra C18 MS column (Waters; 5 l m particle
size, 29 ·  150 mm, OBD) with an X-Terra C18 MS guard
column (Waters; 5 l m particle size, 19 ·  10 mm) ran on a
Waters preparative HPLC system as specified above. The
gradient was similar to the gradient of analytical RPHPLC.
The flow rate was 12 ml/min. Fractions were collected
based on the response at 280 nm as described for
preparative RP-HPLC. The purity of the fractions was
determined using analytical RP-HPLC and the purified
components were lyophilized after evaporation of ACN.
4.7. Liquid chromatography coupled on-line to mass
spectrometry (LC-MS)
 The molecular mass of the lignans and fragments of the
macromolecule were determined on a Thermo Finnigan
LCQ Classic coupled on-line to the analytical RP-HPLC.
The flow from the analytical RP-HPLC was split: 1/10th
was directed to the MS. The MS was equipped with an
ESI injector. Spectra were obtained in the negative ion
mode over an m /z  range of 150–2000 Da. The capillary
temperature was 270  C, the capillary voltage was
 7.00 V, the ion spray voltage was set on 4.50 kV and
helium was used as sheath gas. MS/MS analysis was performed
with a normalized collision energy of 27%.
4.8. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC)
 To determine the molecular weight distribution of the
lignan macromolecule and the saponified lignans, aliquots
of 50 l l (2 mg/ml) were analyzed on a similar HPLC system
as described for analytical RP-HPLC, equipped with
a Tricorn Superdex Peptide 10/300 GL column (Amersham
Bioscience; 10 ·  300–310 mm, bed volume = 24 ml, optimum
separation range 100–7000 Da). The column was
run isocratically at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min with 40% (v/
v) aq. ACN + 0.1% (v/v) TFA as eluent. The eluate was
monitored at 280 nm. The included volume (Vinc  =
16.5 ml) was determined with water. It should be noted
that part of the compounds eluted later than the included
volume indicating that aspecific interactions occurred. No
further calibration was performed since no suitable calibration
compounds were available.
4.9. Matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight
mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS)
 For the qualification of the molecular weight distribution
of unsaponified lignan macromolecule, this sample
was analyzed on a Ultraflex MALDI-TOF MS (Bruker
Daltronics GmbH). As matrix 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid
dissolved in 50% aq. ACN (15 mg/ml) was used. 2 l l of
sample mixture consisting of 10 l l 2 mg/ml unsaponified
(0 mM) lignan macromolecule, 10 l l matrix-solution and
1 l l 1 mM NaAc pH 5 was spotted on a gold plate. The
MALDI-TOF MS was calibrated with a mixture of malto
dextrins (mass range 365–4092). The system was used in the
positive reflector mode.
4.10. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
 Prior to NMR analyses, the samples were solved in
99.8% CD3 OD + 0.05% (v/v) TMS (Cambridge Isotope
Laboratories, USA). NMR spectra were recorded at a
probe temperature of 25  C on a Bruker AMX-500 spectrometer
located at the Wageningen NMR Centre. Chemical
shifts were expressed in ppm relative to TMS at
0.00 ppm.
The 1 H and 13 C proton decoupled spectra were recorded
at 500.13 MHz and 125.77 Hz, respectively. All 2 D COSY
spectra were acquired using the double quantum filtered
(DQF) method with a standard pulse sequence delivered
by Bruker.
For the 2 D HMBC spectrum a standard gradient
enhanced 2 D HMQC pulse sequence delivered by Bruker,
was changed into a HMBC sequence by setting the delay
between the first proton and carbon pulse to 50 ms.
