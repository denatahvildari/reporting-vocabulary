Purification of Ovalbumin
A batch of ovalbumin was purified from fresh hen eggs
using the following semi-large-scale procedure, based on
the literature-described purification protocols (Takahashi
et al., 1996; Vachier et al., 1995). Egg white was separated
from egg yolk by hand using 9-day fresh hen eggs. To the
total egg white fraction (about 300 ml), 600 ml of a 50 mM
Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 10 mM -mercaptoethanol
was added. This solution was stirred for 24 h at 4ÅãC.
Subsequently, the solution was centrifuged for 30 min at
14,000g, 4ÅãC. The pellet was discarded, while 1,800 ml of
50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) was added to the supernatant.
After 30 min gentle stirring, the solution was filtered over a
paper filter (Schleicher & Schuell, Keene, NH). To the filtrate,
500 g of DEAE Sepharose Cl-6B (Pharmacia,
Uppsala, Sweden) was added, followed by overnight incubation
at 4ÅãC with gentle stirring. Next, the solution was
filtered over a glass filter (G2) followed by extensive washing
with 10 L demineralized water and 5 L 0.1 M NaCl,
successively. The protein was eluted stepwise with subsequent
steps of 1 L of 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25, and 0.35 M NaCl.
The eluents with 0.25 and 0.35 M NaCl appear generally
yellowish. The 0.15 and 0.2 M NaCl batches were pooled
and concentrated using a Millipore (Bedford, MA) Ultrafiltration
Unit with a 30 kDa molecular mass cut-off membrane.
The concentrated solution was dialyzed extensively
against demineralized water and afterwards freeze-dried in a
Lyovac GT 2 operating at −20ÅãC and 0.1–0.5 mbar. The
freeze-dried ovalbumin was stored at −40ÅãC until further
use. Generally, the yield of this procedure is about 1.0 g
ovalbumin per egg and the efficiency of isolation is over
90%. Purity of the protein was over 98% as estimated from
densitometric analysis of SDS-PAGE gels. Electron-spray
mass spectroscopy (results not shown) showed that the protein
isolated here contained a sugar moiety of 1,565 Da
(linked to Asn293) with one 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-glucose
and no mannose units as additional substituents to the
common backbone (Rago et al., 1992). No heterogeneity in
natural glycosylation could be identified.
Chemical Modification of Ovalbumin
S-Ovalbumin
S-ovalbumin was prepared from ovalbumin according to the
method described by Smith and Back (1965). An amount of
2.5 g ovalbumin was dissolved in 60 ml demineralized water
and the pH of this solution was set at 9.9 by dropwise
addition of 0.1 M NaOH. The resulting solution was incubated
at 55ÅãC for 72 h. Subsequently, the solution was
dialyzed extensively against demineralized water at 4ÅãC.
After dialysis, the pH of the solution was 6.7 and the protein
was freeze-dried as described above. The final material was
stored at −20ÅãC until use.
Succinylation
Amino groups in ovalbumin were succinylated essentially
as described by Klotz (1967). To this end, 100 ml solution
of 25 mg/ml ovalbumin (0.55 mM) in demineralized water
was set at pH 8.0 by the addition of 3 M NaOH using pH-stat titration equipment (Metrohm) at room temperature.
Then 300 mg of solid succinic anhydride was added stepwise
in five portions yielding a final concentration of 30 mM
succinic anhydride. During the addition of succinic anhydride
the pH was kept at 8 (Å}0.1) by the addition of 1 M
NaOH using pH-stat equipment. After addition, the solution
was stirred for another 30 min, followed by extensive dialysis
against demineralized water at 4ÅãC and subsequent
freeze-drying. The material was stored at −20ÅãC until use.
Methylation
Carboxylic acid groups in ovalbumin were methylated using
an adaptation of the procedure described by Hoare and
Koshland (1967). A 250 ml solution of 10 mg/ml ovalbumin
(0.22 mM) containing 1 M methylamine was set to pH 4.6
and stirred at room temperature. Subsequently, solid EDC
(4.75 g) was added stepwise in four portions to give a final
concentration of 100 mM, while the pH was kept at 4.6 by
the addition of 1 M NaOH using pH-stat equipment. When
all added EDC was dissolved the solution was stirred for
another 2 h. Subsequently, the pH was raised to 8 by dropwise
addition of NaOH (1 M) and after another 24 h of
stirring at room temperature the mixture was dialyzed extensively
against demineralized water (4ÅãC) followed by
freeze-drying. Prior to further analysis, the material was
stored at −20ÅãC. The methylation reaction took place in the
presence of 150 g/ml sodium azide to prevent microbial
growth.
Lipophilization
To increase the reactivity of capric acid towards free amino
groups, the fatty acid was esterified with N-hydroxysuccinic
acid in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran essentially according to
the procedure described by Lapidot and Wolman (1967).
The yield of the esterification reaction was 70% and the
purity of the obtained activated capric acid was over 95%.
The purity and identity of the activated capric acid was
confirmed (>97% purity) using thin-layer chromatography
(TLC), mass spectrometry, and NMR (results not shown).
Activated capric acid was covalently coupled to ovalbumin
by reaction with its free amino groups, essentially as described
by Liu et al. (2000). Therefore, ovalbumin was dissolved
at a concentration of 8.5 mg/ml in 250 ml 100 mM
sodium carbonate buffer of pH 8.5. Activated capric acid
was dissolved at a concentration of 1.4 mg/ml in 40 ml
DMSO and subsequently added to the ovalbumin solution.
This gave end concentrations of 0.2 mM ovalbumin and
0.7 mM activated capric acid.
This mixture was incubated at 40ÅãC for 18 h. After incubation
the mixture was dialyzed extensively at 4ÅãC
against 10 mM ammonium carbonate buffer of pH 7 and
subsequently demineralized water, followed by freezedrying.
The freeze-dried material was stored at −20ÅãC until
use.
Glycosylation
One gram freeze-dried ovalbumin was dissolved in 200 ml
demineralized water and was mixed with 200 mL 5 mg/ml
fructose or glucose (i.e., 1 amine group to 6.5 sugar molecules).
The pH was then adjusted to 7.0 with 0.1 M HCl.
These mixtures were frozen at −20ÅãC and subsequently
freeze-dried. Next, the samples were incubated at 45ÅãC at a
relative humidity of 69% for 2 h. The incubation is performed
under normal atmospheric composition and no other
components were added. Finally, the preparations were extensively
dialyzed against demineralized water to remove
nonreacted sugar, followed by freeze-drying and storage at
−20ÅãC until further use.
