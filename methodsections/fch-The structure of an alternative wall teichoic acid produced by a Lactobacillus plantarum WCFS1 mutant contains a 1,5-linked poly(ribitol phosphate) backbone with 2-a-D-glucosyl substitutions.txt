1. Experimental
1.1. Bacterial strains and culture conditions
The Lactobacillus plantarum tagF1–tagF2 mutant11 was cultivated
in de Man–Rogosa–Sharpe (MRS) broth (Merck), supplemented
with 10 lg/mL chloramphenicol. After incubating at 37 C
for 20 h cells had reached the stationary phase of growth and were
harvested by centrifugation at 11,000g for 10 min at 4 C.
1.2. Preparations of WTA
WTA was prepared from a cell wall fraction of the L. plantarum
tagF1–tagF2 mutant as described previously.11 Briefly, the cell
walls were prepared by ultrasonication of cells, followed by successive
treatments with SDS, DNase, and RNase (Sigma–Aldrich),
and Pepsin (Sigma–Aldrich). WTA was released from the cell walls
by 10% CCl3CO2H treatment at 4 C for 48 h and collected by EtOH
precipitation at 4 C. WTA was loaded on a DEAE-Sepharose Fast
Flow column (5.0  5 cm, GE Healthcare) using an AKTA fast performance
liquid chromatography system (GE Healthcare) and
eluted using four column volumes of a linear gradient of 0–1.0 M
NaCl in 100 mM NaOAc buffer (pH 4.8). The fractions containing
neutral sugars22 and organic phosphate23 were pooled, dialyzed
against water (Spectra/Por 1, Spectrum Laboratories), and
lyophilized.
1.3. Preparation of glucosylribitol unit
The glucosylribitol (GlcRbo) unit of WTA from the tagF1–tagF2
mutant was prepared as described previously.10 Briefly, 60 mg of
WTA was degraded in 1 M NaOH at 100 C for 1 h and fractionated
on a Sephadex G-25 (GE Healthcare) column (1.6  110 cm) with
water. The fractions containing neutral sugars as visualized by
the phenol–H2SO4 assay22 were collected and lyophilized (8 mg).
Subsequently, the neutral sugar containing fractions were treated
with 0.5 U/mL bacterial alkaline phosphatase (Sigma–Aldrich) in
100 mM glycine–NaOH buffer (pH 10.4) at 37 C for 24 h. The
GlcRbo unit in the solution was separated by adsorbing the sugar
moiety on a charcoal powder-Celite 535 (1:1, w/w) column, followed
by passage through a small column packed with DEAE Toyopearl
650M resin (Tosoh).10 The GlcRbo unit was subsequently
isolated using a HPLC system equipped with a refractive index
detector (RID-10A, Shimadzu) and a fraction collector (FRC-10A,
Shimadzu), on a Shodex Asahipak NH2P-50 4E column (Showa
Denko) with water–CH3CN (25:75, v/v).
1.4. Compositional analysis
For the fractions obtained from the chromatography, organic
phosphate was detected by ashing with Mg(NO3)2, followed by
the molybdenum blue method as described by Ames,23 and neutral
sugars were assessed by the phenol–H2SO4 method.22
Compositional analysis of sugars and alditols were carried out
on a HPAEC system (ICS-3000, Dionex) with a pulsed amperometric
detector (PAD), on a CarboPac PA-1 column (Dionex) at 20 C.
Separation was performed at a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min, using gradient
elution by mixing water, 0.1 M NaOH, and 1 M NaOAc in
0.1 M NaOH as described by Verhoef et al.24 Analytical samples
for HPAEC were prepared by methanolysis in 2 M HCl in dry MeOH at 80 C for 16 h, followed by 1 h of 2 M CF3CO2H treatment at
121 C.
Sugar phosphates in the NaOH hydrolysate of the WTA were
analyzed on an Accela UPLC system (Thermo Fischer Scientific)
coupled to a LTQ-XL Linear Iontrap Mass Spectrometer equipped
with an electrospray ionization source (Thermo Fisher Scientific),
as described by Leijdekkers et al.25 with minor modifications. Chromatographic
separation was performed on an Acquity UPLC BEH
amide (Waters) column at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min with an oven
temperature of 35 C. Compounds were eluted using a gradient of
CH3CN in 10 mM ammonium formate–0.1% (v/v) formic acid buffer
(pH 3.0), with the following elution profile: 0–1 min, isocratic 80%
CH3CN (v/v); 1–31 min, 80–50%; 31–36 min, 50–20%. Ions were detected
in the following MS conditions: polarity, negative mode;
mass range, m/z 150–2000; ion source voltage, 4.5 kV; capillary
voltage, 5 V; capillary temperature, 250 C. Analytical sample
for UPLC-MS was prepared by hydrolysis in 0.5 M NaOH at
100 C for 1 h followed by neutralization with 6 M HCl. After mixing
the hydrolysate and CH3CN in a ratio 1:1 (v/v) 10 lL of the mixture
was injected.
1.5. NMR spectroscopy
For sample preparation 20 and 2 mg of the purified WTA and
the GroRbo unit were dissolved in 400 and 100 lL of D2O (Sigma–
Aldrich), respectively. For the GroRbo unit, NMR spectra were
measured in a Shigemi NMR microtube (Shigemi). 1D and 2D COSY,
TOCSY, HSQC, and HMBC spectra were recorded on an AVANCE III
500 MHz NMR spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics) at 300 K with proton
and carbon frequencies of 500.13 and 125.77 MHz. The 2D
NMR spectra were acquired with 512 increments of 2–4 scans for
COSY, 512 increments of 4–8 scans for TOCSY, 512 increments of
8 scans for HSQC, and 1024 increments of 32 scans for HMBC.
The mixing time for the TOCSY spectra was 100 ms. Sodium 3-(trimethylsilyl)
propionic-2,2,3,3-d4 acid (Sigma–Aldrich) was used as
an internal reference for chemical shift (dH 0.00 and dC 0.00).
1.6. MALDI-TOF ms
MALDI-TOF MS analysis was performed on an ultrafleXtreme
MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics) equipped
with a SmartBeam II laser (Bruker Daltonics), in the positive ion
mode.26 After a delayed extraction time of 120 ns, ions were accelerated
in an electric field of 25 kV and detected using reflector
mode. The GlcRbo compounds were dissolved in water (2 mg/
mL), and 1 lL of sample was mixed on a MALDI target plate with
1 lL of saturated matrix solution of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid
(Bruker Daltonics) in 50% CH3CN, and dried under an air stream. A mixture of maltodextrins (ranging from m/z 400 to 3000) was
used for calibration.
