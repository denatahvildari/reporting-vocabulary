 3. Experimental
3.1. Plant material
Arabidopsis thaliana (L) Heyn. Ecotype Col-0 was used
for all experiments.
Plants were grown in peat at an 8 h photoperiod at 100–
120 lmol photons m2 s1, 20C, 70% relative humidity
and watered using tap water when necessary.
Plant material (green tissue) was harvested as young
leaves (small rosettes 10–12 leaf stage), mature leaves (12
weeks), stems (including flowers and silliques) and seeds.
Roots were obtained from plants grown hydroponically
according to Husted et al. (2002).
3.2. Preparation of cell wall material (CWM)
Cell wall material was prepared as follows: alcohol
insoluble residue (AIR) was prepared as described (Fry,
1988) with adaptations. Tissue of interest was ground in
liquid nitrogen with a mortar and pestle and boiled in
96% ethanol for 30 min. The supernatant was removed
after centrifugation at 10,000g for 5 min. The pellet was
washed with 70% ethanol with subsequent centrifugation
until it appeared free of chlorophyll. A final wash with
100% acetone was performed and the pellet was dried
under vacuum.
Alcohol insoluble residue (AIR) was treated with
enzymes for the removal of starch. For this, AIR was suspended
in 10 volumes of a solution that had been preheated
to 95 C containing 10 mM potassium phosphate
buffer (pH 6.5), 1 mM CaCl2, and 0.05% NaN3. Starch
was allowed to gelatinize for 30 s before addition of thermostable
a-amylase  (Megazyme, Bray, Ireland) to a final  concentration of 1 U/ml. The suspension was incubated at
85  C for 15 min. After the incubation the sample was
cooled to 25  C and amyloglucosidase and pullulanase
(both from Megazyme) were added to a final concentration
of 1 U/ml. The a -amylase, amyloglucosidase and pullulanase
preparation were investigated by SDS–PAGE and
appeared to give one band only, except for an extra faint
band for the pullulanase preparation. Additionally, no pectinolytic
side activities were detected in these enzyme preparations.
The suspension was incubated for 16 h at 25  C,
with continuous shaking at 500 rpm. The suspension was
centrifuged for 10 min at 6000g . The pellet was washed
with 50 ml of a solution containing 10 mM potassium
phosphate (pH 6.5), 1 mM CaCl2 , and 0.05% NaN3 , centrifuged
again at 6000g  for 10 min, and finally dried under
vacuum. The de-starched cell wall material was extracted
with phenol:acetic acid:water (2:1:1, v/v/v) for 3 h (1:10
(w/v) ratio between AIR and phenol:acetic acid:water
2:1:1) at room temperature followed by centrifugation at
6000g  for 5 min. The pellet (CWM) was washed three times
with water to remove phenol and extracted proteins and
finally dried under vacuum.
3.3. Saponification of CWM
 Pectin, as present in CWM from seeds, root, stem,
young leaves and mature leaves was saponified in 0.1 M
sodium hydroxide for 24 h at 4  C and subsequently neutralized
with 0.1 M acetic acid. After neutralization, samples
were dialyzed overnight against MilliQ water and
freeze-dried until further use. Saponified CWM is referred
to as CWM-s.
3.4. Pectin extraction from CWM-s
 Pectin was extracted from 200 mg, 100 mg, 130 mg,
20 mg, and 105 mg of CWM-s from seeds, root, stem,
young leaves and mature leaves of A. thaliana  according
to the method of Voragen et al. (1983) . For this extraction
a cold solution of 5 mM EDTA in 50 mM NaOH (4  C)
was used.
The obtained pectin and pellet fractions from each type
of CWM-s were dialyzed overnight against distilled water.
Aliquots of these fractions were freeze-dried prior to analysis
of their sugar compositions (see Section 3.5 ). The total
concentration of soluble polysaccharides in the pectin fractions
as well as the total concentration of the residue in the
pellet fractions was calculated using the yield of dry material
from the freeze dried aliquots of these fractions.
The remainder of the pectin fractions as well as the pellet
fractions were dialyzed against 50 mM NaOAc (pH 3.5)
prior to treatment by XGH, see Section 3.7 .
3.5. Neutral sugar composition and uronic acid content
 CWM-s, as well as the corresponding pectin and pellet
fractions, were analyzed for their neutral sugar compositions
using gas chromatography, after derivatization to
alditol acetates (Englyst and Cummings, 1984 ). Inositol
was used as internal standard. The samples were hydrolyzed
in 72% (w/w) H2 SO4  for 1 h at 30  C, followed by a
treatment in 1 M H2 SO4  for 3 h at 100  C. The uronic acid
content of the samples was determined by an automated mhydroxydiphenyl
assay (Blumenkrantz and Asboe-Hansen,
1973; Thibault and Robin, 1975 ). Analysis of the neutral
sugar composition and uronic acid content of the samples
were performed in duplicate.
3.6. Substrates and enzymes
 Xylogalacturonan (XGA-29) was prepared from gum
tragacanth by treatment with alkali and trifluoro acetic
acid (TFA) as described (Beldman et al., 2003 ). This
XGA had a Xyl:GalA ratio of 0.29.
A set of XGA oligosaccharides with known structures
and with different GalA/Xyl ratios were obtained as
described (Zandleven et al., 2005 ).
The enzyme xylogalacturonan hydrolase (XGH) from
Aspergillus tubingensis  was cloned (Van der Vlugt-Bergmans
et al., 2000 ) and expressed in the A. niger  ‘‘PlugBug’’
(DSM Food Specialities, Delft, the Netherlands). This
enzyme was purified as described (Beldman et al., 2003 )
and had a specific activity of 150 U/mg.
3.7. Enzyme incubations
 One ml from the dialyzed pectin or pellet fraction (ranging
in concentration between 1 and 6 mg/ml) from the different
plant organs was incubated with XGH for 20 h at
30  C. The final enzyme concentration was 0.35 l g/ml,
which should be able to degrade all XGA possibly present
in these samples during the incubation period. Subsequently,
the enzyme was inactivated by heating the reaction
mixtures for 10 min at 100  C. The XGH treated samples
were analyzed by HPAEC using a set of known XGA-oligosaccharides
for identification (Zandleven et al., 2005 ).
GalA, GalA2 , and GalA3 , (all 10 mM) were taken as standards
to calculate the concentration of the corresponding
oligosaccharides, as well as of the xylogalacturonan oligosaccharides.
For the calculation of the XGA oligosaccharides
it was assumed that xylose substitution has no
significant effect on the response factor of galacturonan oligosaccharides
(Sakamoto et al., 2002 ). The standard GalA3
 was also used to calculate concentrations of oligosaccharides
with a degree of polymerization (DP) of 4 and higher,
based on the experience that the differences in response fac factors
for these larger oligosaccharides are relatively small.
3.8. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry
 XGH-treated pectin samples were desalted by treatment
with H+ -Dowex AG 50W X8 (Biorad, Hercules, CA),
using a final concentration of 350 mg H+ -Dowex per ml
digest. The desalted digests were mixed with a matrix  solution (1 l l of sample in 1 l l of matrix) and applied on a
MALDI sample plate. The matrix solution was prepared
by dissolving 9 mg of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid in a 1-ml
mixture of acetonitrile:water (300 l l: 700 l l). MALDITOF
MS analysis was performed using an Ultraflex workstation
(Bruker Daltonics, Hamburg, Germany) equipped
with a nitrogen laser of 337 nm. The mass spectrometer
was selected for positive ions, which were accelerated by
an electric field of 12 kV, after a delayed extraction time
of 200 ns. The ions were detected in the reflector mode.
External calibration of the mass spectrometer was performed
using a mixture of maltodextrines (mass range
365–2309).
