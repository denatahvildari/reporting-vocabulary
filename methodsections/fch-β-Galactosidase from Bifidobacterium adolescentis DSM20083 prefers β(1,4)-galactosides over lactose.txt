Materials and methods
Bacterial strains, and growth conditions
Bifidobacterium adolescentis DSM 20083 was purchased
from the Deutsche Sammlung von Microorganismen und
Zellkulturen. The strain was grown anaerobically using
MRS medium pH 6.0 (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes,
N.J.) supplemented with 0.5 g/l cysteine at 37°C. DNA
cloning was performed using the Escherichia coli strain
XL1 blue MRF′ (Promega, Madison, Wis.). The E. coli
strain was grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth or solidified
LB medium (15 g agar/l) supplemented with 100 μg/ml
ampicillin when appropriate.
The E. coli cells containing the β-galactosidase gene (β-
Gal II) were grown in LB broth or solidified LB medium
supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 1 mM
isopropyl β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG).
Chemicals, substrates, and enzymes
Chemicals were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, Mo.)
unless stated otherwise. Restriction enzymes and other
enzymes used for DNA manipulation were obtained from
MBI Fermentas (St. Leon Rot, Germany) and were used
according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The
mixture of TOS was purchased from Borculo Domo
Ingredients (Zwolle, The Netherlands) and was fractionated
as described by Van Laere et al. (2000). Transgalacto-
oligosaccharides (TOS) were obtained by transgalactosylation
of lactose with a β-galactosidase. The
preparation of the [β-D-Galp-(1,4)]n-D-Galp oligosaccharides
will be discussed in detail elsewhere. Briefly, they
were obtained on a small scale (approximately 10 mg per
oligosaccharide) by partially degrading potato galactan
with an endo-galactanase from Aspergillus niger, followed
by BioGel P2 (Bio-Rad, Hercules, Calif.)size exclusion
chromatography. Three purified oligosaccharide fractions
were obtained, designated as [β-D-Galp-(1,4)]n-D-Galp
with n=2, n=3 and n>3. The molecular size of the products
were verified by Maldi TOF MS. The β-galactosidase
from A. niger was purchased from Megazyme (Bray,
Ireland).
Isolation and cloning of the β-galactosidase
β-Gal II gene
The β-galactosidase enzyme (β-Gal II) was isolated as
described by Van Laere et al. (2000). Internal amino acid
sequences were determined by the Sequence Centre of
Utrecht University and was performed as described
previously (Van Casteren et al. 2000). From these internal
amino acid sequences the primers GAL23F, GAL1R,
GAL1F, and GAL31R were designed (5′-
GCSTCSGGHGGYGAYTACAAYCCV, 5′-CTRTARCASGGSRAVCGSATG,
5′-GAYATYGTSCCSYTBGCSTAC,
and 5′-GARGARTTCAACATYYTSGGYGCSGARGCC,
respectively, in which Y represents T or C, S
represents C or G, R represents A or G, H represents T, C
or A, B represents T, C or G, and V represents C, A or G).
Genomic DNA of B. adolescentis DSM20083 was
isolated using a modified Marmur procedure as described
by Johnson (1994). The polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
was carried out on the genomic DNA with primers
GAL23F, GAL1R, GAL1F, and GAL31R and Taq Polymerase
(HT Biotechnology, Cambridge, UK). The resulting
DNA fragments were purified from the PCR mixture
with a High Pure PCR Product Purification Kit (Roche,
Mannheim, Germany). The DNA fragments were ligated
into a pGEM T-easy vector (Promega) and transformed
into E. coli XL1 blue MRF′ cells. The cells were grown for
16 h at 37°C on solid S-Gal/LB agar plates (Sigma)
supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Colonies
containing a cloned PCR-fragment were identified as
white colonies. Plasmid DNA was prepared by following
the Qiagen plasmid purification method (Qiagen, Hilden,
Germany). The plasmid containing the largest PCR
fragment (23F31R) was used to prepare a digoxigenin
(DIG)-labelled DNA fragment according to the instructions
of the manufacturer (Boehringer, Mannheim, Germany).
The labelled PCR fragment was used for colony
hybridisation as described by Sambrook et al. (1989) on a
genomic library of B. adolescentis DSM20083 (Van den
Broek et al. 1999). Detection was according to the
instructions of the manufacturer (Boehringer). Colonies
hybridising with the labelled fragment were identified as
black spots on an X-ray film. Two colonies were
identified, each containing a part of the β-Gal II gene.
PCR was carried out with the proofreading polymerase
High Fidelity PCR Cloning Enzyme Easy A (Stratagene,
La Jolla, Calif.) on B. adolescentis genomic DNA, using
two primers for amplification of the full-length β-Gal II
gene. Two XbaI restriction sites were introduced at the
beginning and end of the gene for cloning purposes. The
primers used were: CGF (5′-GGGGTCTAGAGCATACCAGGGCGATATCGG)
and CGR (5′-GGGGTCTAGATTACCGCCTTACCACGAGCACG).
The PCR product
(β-Gal II) was purified from the PCR mixture as described
above and digested with XbaI. β-Gal II was cloned into an
XbaI-digested pBluescript vector (Stratagene) and transformed
into E. coli XL1 blue MRF′ cells.
Isolation and characterisation of β-galactosidase
β-Gal II
Cells from an E. coli cell culture (700 ml, LB-medium,
37°C, overnight) containing the β-Gal II gene were
harvested by centrifugation (15 min; 8,000 g; 4°C). The
supernatant was removed and used for activity measurement;
the cells were suspended in 90 ml 50 mM sodium
acetate buffer pH 4.5 and disrupted by sonic treatment (10
min; duty cycle 30%; Sonifier 250, Branson Ultrasonics,
Danbury, Conn.) on ice. Subsequently, the suspension was
centrifuged (15 min; 8,000 g; 4°C), the supernatant
collected, and the pellet suspended in 45 ml 50 mM was performed. This step was repeated twice. The cell-free
extracts were pooled and applied to a Q-Sepharose
(Amersham, Little Chalfont, UK) anion-exchange column.
Elution took place with a linear gradient of 0–0.5 M NaCl
in 50 mM sodium acetate pH 4.5 at a flow rate of 57 cm/h.
Fractions with the highest β-galactosidase activity were
pooled and further purified on a Superdex 200 PG
(Amersham) size-exclusion column. Elution was performed
with 0.15 M NaCl in 20 mM potassium phosphate
buffer pH 6.0 at a flow rate of 30 cm/h.
Protein concentration was determined by the method of
Bradford (1976) using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a
standard. SDS-PAGE was carried out on the Pharmacia
Phastsystem according to the instructions of the supplier
(Amersham). Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining was used
for the detection of proteins on PhastGel 10–15% gradient
gels (Amersham). The native molecular mass was
estimated by size-exclusion chromatography using the
Akta Purifier equipped with a Superdex 200 PG column
(Amersham). The column was calibrated with thyroglobulin
(669 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), catalase (232 kDa),
aldolase (158 kDa), BSA (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa),
chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa), and ribonuclease A (13.7
kDa). Elution was performed with 20 mM potassium
phosphate buffer pH 6.0 containing 0.15 M NaCl at a flow
rate of 76 cm/h.
N-Terminal amino acid sequence determination was
carried out at the Sequence Centre of Utrecht University
and was performed as described previously (Van Casteren
et al. 2000).
Enzyme assays
β-Galactosidase activity was measured by determining the
hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactopyranoside (pNPGal)
at 37°C after 10 min incubation. The reaction mixture
(125 μl) consisted of 2 mM potassium phosphate buffer
pH 6.0, and 0.2 mg/ml pNP-Gal solution. The reaction
was stopped by adding an equal volume of 0.5 M glycine/
NaOH buffer pH 9.0, containing 2 mM EDTA. The colour
formation was measured at 400 nm. One unit (U) of
activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that liberates
1 μmol galactose per minute under the specified
conditions. The molar extinction coefficient under these
assay conditions was 13,700 M−1 cm−1. This assay was
also used to measure the stability of the enzyme and the
temperature optimum between 4°C and 80°C. For determination
of the pH optimum, McIlvain buffers (0.1 M
citric acid/0.2 M di-sodium phosphate) in the range of pH
2.5–7.5 were used.
For kinetic experiments, β-D-Galp-(1,4)-D-Galp [hereafter
referred to as Gal(β1–4)Gal] concentration was
varied in the range of 0.05–8.0 mg/ml and measured by
high-performance anion-exchange chromatography
(HPAEC). The reactions were carried out in 2 mM
potassium phosphate buffer pH 6.0 and 0.12 U/ml β-
galactosidase for 60 min at 37°C. The incubations were
stopped by heating the incubation mixtures for 5 min at
100°C. After centrifugation (5 min, 10,000 g) the supernatant
was analysed by HPAEC using a Dionex system
equipped with a Dionex CarboPac PA-1 (4 mm ID Å~ 250
mm) column in combination with a CarboPac PA guard
column (3 mm ID Å~25 mm) and a pulsed electrochemical
detector in pulsed amperometric detection (PAD) mode
(Dionex, Sunnyvale, Calif.). A flow rate of 1 ml/min was
used with the following gradient of sodium acetate in 0.1
M NaOH: 0–15 min, 0–100 mM; 15–20 min, 100–200
mM; 20–21 min, 200–1,000 mM. Each elution was
followed by a washing step of 5 min in 1,000 mM sodium
acetate and an equilibration step of 15 min 0.1 M NaOH.
The hydrolytic activity of β-Gal II towards different
types of oligosaccharides was measured by HPAEC, using
the same gradient as for the kinetic experiments. The
incubations were performed with 1 mg/ml substrate under
the conditions described above.
Transglycosylation activity was measured with 100 mg/
ml TOS, 0.12 U/ml β-Gal II, and 2 mM phosphate buffer
pH 6.0. For hydrolytic activity towards TOS, a concentration
of 1 mg/ml was used, while the other conditions
were kept similar to the transglycosylation assay. The
reactions were stopped by heating the incubation mixtures
for 5 min at 100°C, after which the reaction mixture was
centrifuged (5 min, 10,000 g) and the supernatant analysed
by HPAEC.
DNA sequencing and sequence analysis
An automated DNA sequencer 373 (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, Calif.) was used to determine the nucleotide
sequence of the gene. The DNA sequence data were
submitted to the GenBank nucleotide databases under the
accession number AY359872. The BLAST2 program
(Altschul et al. 1997, available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.
nih.gov/) was used to search for sequence homologies
