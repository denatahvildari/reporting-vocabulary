 EXPERIMENTAL
Materials
Caffeoylquinic acid (CQA; 1,3,4,5-tetrahydroxycyclohexanecarboxylic
acid 3-(3,4)-dihydroxypropenyldihydroxyphenyl-
1-propenoate), amino acids and
the corresponding amino acids protected at their Nterminal
group by a tert-butyloxycarbonyl group (Boc)
were purchased from Sigma Chemical Company (St
Louis, MO, USA) and used without further purification.
Tyrosinase from mushroom (EC 1.14.18.1,
PPO) was purchased from Fluka (Steinheim, Germany)
and had an activity of 3216 U mg−1 (1 U
oxidizing 1 μmol of 4-methylcatechol min−1 at pH 6.5
and 25 ◦C; Fluka).
 Amino acid modification
Protected (Boc-) or unprotected amino acids
(112 mmol L−1) were mixed with CQA (28 mmol
L−1) and PPO (15 U mL−1) in 0.1mol L−1 potassium
phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). The molar ratio used
during PPO oxidation was different from that used
under alkaline conditions, because preliminary experiments
with PPO showed that this molar ratio (4 mol
CQA mol−1 of amino acid) results in a visibly higher
reaction rate than at lower and higher ratios. The pH
of the mixtures was adjusted to pH 7.0 with 6 mol
L−1 NaOH. Next, the samples were stirred for 24 h
at 40 ◦C in a water bath in open vials. Blanks of
CQA, protected amino acid and non-protected amino
acids were prepared. Each CQA–amino acid solution
was prepared in duplicate. All samples were directly
analysed by LC-MS after similar reaction times.
As PPO can hydroxylate (Boc-)tyrosine, the
interactions were also studied using CQA oxidized
at alkaline pH in order to be able to identify which
products from the PPO mixture were not due to
hydroxylation of tyrosine. Boc-tyrosine or tyrosine
(28mmol L−1) was mixed with CQA (28mmol
L−1) in water and the pH was adjusted to pH 9.0
with 6mol L−1 NaOH. The molar ratio between
amino acid residue and CQA was that chosen in a
previous study on protein–CQA interactions.1 Next,
the samples were stirred for 24 h in open vials.
Blanks consisting of CQA, Boc-tyrosine and tyrosine
were prepared in a similar way. After dilution by
a factor of 100, absorption spectra were recorded
from 1100 to 190nm using a Shimadzu UV-1601
spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan).
 Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry
Tenmicrolitres of sample were applied to a Vydac C18
reversed-phase column (300A° ; 5 μm; 0.46 °ø 25 cm;
Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) on a Spectra System
high-performance liquid chromatograph (Thermo
Separation Products, Inc., San Jose, CA, USA)
coupled to an LCQ mass spectrometer (Finnigan
MAT, San Jose, CA, USA). The solvents used were
water containing trifluoroacetic acid (1.5mL L−1)
(solvent A) and acetonitrile containing trifluoroacetic
acid (1.5mL L−1) (solvent B). The following gradient
was applied: 0% B for 5min, linear to 25% B between
5 and 45 min, linear to 50% B between 45 and
68 min, linear to 100% B between 68 and 77min,
100% B between 77 min and 82 min, followed by
reconditioning of the column at 0% B for 27 min. A
flow rate of 0.2mL min−1 was used. The absorbance
of the eluate was monitored at 700 nm. The mass
spectrum was collected using the positive electrospray
ionization (ESI) mode with a capillary heated at
200 ◦C, a source voltage of 4.5 kV, and a sheath
gas flow of 60 arbitrary units with helium as the
spraying gas. Full-scan spectra were acquired from
100 to 2000 m/z. The tune method was made with
a glycine tripeptide. MS-MS fragmentation patterns
were also recorded. Data were processed using
Xcalibur software (Finnigan MAT).
