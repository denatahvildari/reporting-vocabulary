2. Materials and methods
2.1. Isolation of apolar feruloylated and/or acetylated
oligosaccharides
Feruloylated oligosaccharides were isolated from dilute acid
pretreated corn fiber followed by enzymatic saccharification as described
previously.2 In short, the pretreated corn fiber (11% (w/w)
DM and 0.22% (w/w) H2SO4 heated for 30 min at 140 C) was
subjected to simultaneous saccharification with the enzymes Spirizyme
(Aspergillus niger commercial product), endo-(1–4)-b-xylanase
(Humicola insolens from glycosyl hydrolase family 10 (GH10)),
b-xylosidase (Trichoderma reesei GH3) and 2a-L-arabinofuranosidases
(Machairodus giganteus GH51 and H. insolens GH43) from
Novozymes10 and fermentation after which it was shortly heated
to kill yeast and inactivate enzymes. Subsequently, the obtained
mix was filtered and the filtrate was applied onto a solid phase
C18 column (Extract Clean, Grace, Deerfield, IL, USA). Polar and
charged compounds were eluted with water after which the apolar
(feruloylated and/or acetylated) oligosaccharides were eluted with
MeOH. The MeOH fraction (Fraction B2), which represented 26%
(w/w) of the dry matter (DM) and 39% (w/w) of the total soluble
oligosaccharides of the applied material, was evaporated, lyophilized,
and used in this study.
2.2. Enzymatic incubations
2.2.1. Determination of enzyme activities present in Ultraflo L
and AG-II-Hydrolase
The apolar oligosaccharide fraction was incubated with the enzyme
mixtures Ultraflo L from Humicola insolens (20 mg protein/
mL) kindly provided by Novozymes (Bagsvaerd, Denmark) and
AG-II-Hydrolase an experimental enzyme from Aspergillus niger,
(34 mg protein/ml) kindly provided by Erbslöh (Geisenheim,
Germany). Ultraflo L is a b-glucanase enzyme product with
endo-(1–4)-b-xylanase, a-L-arabinofuranosidase11, and feruloyl
esterase12,13 side activities. The precise activities within
AG-II-Hydrolase were not known, so it was tested for a/b-D-galactosidase,
a/b-D-glucuronidase, a-L-arabinosidase, and a-L-arabinofuranosidase
activity by incubation with the corresponding
para-nitrophenyl (PNP) substrates (Sigma–Aldrich, St. Louis, MO,
USA). The PNP substrates (0.1% (w/w), 25 lL) were mixed with
AG-II-Hydrolase (25 lL) and sodium acetate buffer (50 mM, pH 5.0, 75 lL) in a 96-well plate. After one hour incubation at 30 C,
glycine buffer (500 mM, pH 9.0, 150 lL) containing EDTA (2 mM)
was added and the absorbance was measured at 405 nm. These
measurements showed that AG-II-Hydrolase contains b-D-galactosidase
(10.3 U/mg protein) and a-L-arabinofuranosidase (14.5 U/
mg protein) activity and none of the other activities tested for. Both
Ultraflo L and AG-II-Hydrolase were tested for their feruloyl esterase
activity. Stock solutions (10 mg each/mL DMSO) of methylferulate,
methylcaffeate, methylsinapate, and methylcoumarate (Apin
Chemicals, Abingdon, UK) were diluted in sodium acetate buffer
(50 mM, pH 5.8) to 50 lg/mL each and the enzyme mixtures were
added (5% (w/w) protein/substrate). After 20 h incubation at 40 C
the enzymes were inactivated at 100 C for 5 min, centrifuged
(15,000g, RT, 5 min), and 10 times diluted before analysis on RPUHPLC-
UV-MS as described below. Standards of the four methylated
substrates and ferulic, caffeic, sinapic, and coumaric acid were
used for identification and quantification in the range of 0–50 lg/mL.
Both Ultraflo L and AG-II-Hydrolase contain feruloyl esterase activity.
Ultraflo L could hydrolyze all four methyl substrates while AG-IIHydrolase
was mainly active on methylferulate and methylsinapate.
2.2.2. Hydrolysis of apolar oligosaccharides
The apolar oligosaccharide fraction was mixed with each enzyme
mix resulting in a final concentration of 5 mg/mL substrate
in 35 mM sodium acetate buffer pH 5.0. The enzymes were added
in excess with a dosage of 10% (w/w) and 17% (w/w) protein/substrate
for Ultraflo L and AG-II-Hydrolase respectively. The mixture
was incubated at 30 C for 16 h after which enzymes were inactivated
by boiling for 5 min. After centrifugation (15,000g, RT,
5 min), the sample was desalted by adding a spatula Dowex resin
(AG 50W-X8 Resin, H+,100–200 mesh, BioRad Laboratories, Hercules,
CA) to 30 lL sample and analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS as described
below.
2.3. Fractionation based on size exclusion chromatography
The separation of apolar oligosaccharides was performed on an
AKTA explorer (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) equipped with a
size exclusion Bio-Gel P2 column (900  26 mm; 200–400 mesh,
BioRad) as described previously.2 The instrument was equipped
with both a Shodex RI 72 Refractive Index (Showa Denko, Kawasaki,
and Japan) and PDA detector (GE Healthcare). A flow rate of
1.2 mL/min was used. In total, 867.5 mg of the apolar (feruloylated
and/or acetylated) oligosaccharides was dissolved in 12 mL of distilled
water. Three runs were performed in which 4 mL of sample
was injected each time. During each run fractions (2 mL) were collected.
Based on the RI signal and analysis by MALDI-TOF-MS fractions
with similar contents were pooled and lyophilized resulting
in samples A up to Q. The recovery was about 90% (w/w) of the
DM applied onto the column. The carbohydrate content of samples
A to H was determined after acid methanolysis by high pressure
anion exchange chromatography as described elsewhere.2 For
samples I–Q no carbohydrate content was determined due to small
sample amounts. Based on the average carbohydrate content of
samples A–H, samples I–Q together are expected to contain
±18 mg of oligosaccharides.
2.4. Preparative isolation by reversed phase high pressure liquid
chromatography
AWaters (Milford, MA, USA) system equipped with a 2767 sample
manager, a 2525 binary gradient module, a 2996 photodiode
array detector (PDA) and a UV fraction manager was used. Separation
was performed on a XterraRPC18 19 mm ID  150 mm column
with 5 lm particle size (Waters). The binary mobile phase
consisted of (A) H2O + 1% (v/v) acetonitrile + 0.1% (v/v) HOAc and
(B) acetonitrile + 0.1% (v/v) HOAc. The elution profile was as follows:
The first minute isocratic on 10% B; 1.0–61.0 min, B linearly
from 10% to 22%; 61.0–61.5 min, B linearly from 22% to 100%;
61.5–64.0 min, isocratic on 100% B; 64.0–64.5 min, B linearly from
100% to 10% followed by reconditioning of the column. The flow
rate was 12 mL/min. PDA spectra were recorded from 200–600 nm.
Bio-Gel P2 sample C (45.7 mg) dissolved in 2 mL H2O was separated
in two runs (1 mL sample each run). For Bio-Gel P2 sample E
in total 26.4 mg was dissolved in 1 mL H2O and separated within
one run. Fractions of 6 mL were collected and pooled on the basis
of the PDA spectrum. The fractions that were obtained from injection
of sample C are: (CI) 15.5–17.0 + 18.5–20.0 min and (CII) 39.0–
44.5 min. The fractions that were obtained from injection of
sample E are; (EI) 18.5–21.0 + 21.5–23.5 min and (EII) 24.0–
25.5 + 26.5–28.0 min. Each fraction was rotary evaporated and
subsequently lyophilized. 2.5. Analytical reversed phase UHPLC
Analysis of ferulic acid, feruloylated oligosaccharides, and
reducing end labeled oligosaccharides was performed on an Accela
UHPLC system equipped with an Accela pump, column oven
(30 C), temperature controlled autosampler (10 C), and a photodiode
array detector (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The
system was controlled by Xcalibur software. The column used
was a Hypersyl GOLD, 1.9 mm ID  150 mm column with 1.9 lm
particle size (Thermo Scientific). The mobile phase was composed
of (A) H2O + 1% (v/v) acetonitrile + 0.1–0.2% (v/v) HOAc, and (B)
acetonitrile + 0.1–0.2% (v/v) HOAc. The flow rate was 400 lL/min.
Three different gradients were used. The first gradient (with 0.2%
(v/v) HOAc) was used to determine ferulic acid release by feruloyl
esterase present in Ultraflo L and AG-II-Hydrolase. The first three
min isocratic on 4% B; 3.0–21.0 min, B linearly from 4% to 40%;
21.0–21.5 min, B linearly from 40% to 100%; 21.5–23.0 min, isocratic
on 100% B; 23.0–23.5 min, B linearly from 100% to 4% followed
by reconditioning of the column. The second gradient
(with 0.1% (v/v) HOAc) to separate feruloylated oligosaccharides,
in order to translate it to preparative scale for purification: The first min isocratic on 7% B; 1.0–58.0 min, B linearly from 7% to 21.5%;
58.0–60.0 min, B linearly from 21.5% to 40%; 60.0–60.5 min, B linearly
from 40% to 100%; 60.5–63.0 min isocratic on 100% B; 63.0–
63.5 min, B linearly from 100% to 7% followed by reconditioning of
the column. The third gradient (with 0.1% (v/v) HOAc) was used to
analyze the reducing end labeled oligosaccharides (as described later):
The first min isocratic on 7% B; 1.0–20.0 min, B linearly from
7% to 16.5%; 20.0–30.0 min, B linearly from 16.5% to 26.6%; 30.0–
30.5 min, B linearly from 26.6% to 100%; 30.5–33.5 min isocratic
on 100% B; 33.5–34.0 min, B linearly from 100% to 7% followed
by reconditioning of the column. Spectral data were collected from
200–600 nm.
2.6. Matrix assisted laser desorption time off flight mass
spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS)
One microliter from each sample collected from the Bio-Gel P2
column was mixed with 2 lL matrix solution (2,5-dihydroxybenzoic
acid, 10 mg/mL H2O/ACN (3:7)) on a stainless steel metal
plate. Analysis was performed on an Ultraflex workstation (Bruker
Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) equipped with a 337 nm laser as described
previously.2
2.7. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS)
Mass spectrometry was performed by coupling a LTQ XL ion
trap mass detector equipped with an electrospray ionization
source (Thermo Scientific) to the UHPLC equipment. Spectra were
obtained in the positive mode with an ion spray voltage of
3.0 kV, a capillary voltage of 48 V, and a capillary temperature of
250 C. Optimization of the MS settings was performed
automatically with a crude mix containing feruloylated
oligosaccharides. Full MS scans were made within the m/z range
of 200–2000 and MS2 data of the most intense or selected ions were obtained by collision induced dissociation (CE of 35%). If
needed, additional MSn experiments were performed. Whenever
the mass detector was coupled to the UHPLC apparatus eluents
to which 50 lM sodium salts were added was used for better ionization
of the oligosaccharides.
2.8. NMR spectroscopy
Samples (about 0.5–3.0 mg of CI, CII and EII, see Section 2.4)
were exchanged with D2O (99.9 atom%, Sigma–Aldrich) and subsequently
dissolved in 0.5 mL D2O containing 0.75% 3-(trimethylsilyl)-
propionic-2,2,3,3-d4 acid, sodium salt (TMSP). NMR spectra
were recorded at a probe temperature of 300 K on a Bruker
Avance-III-600 spectrometer, equipped with a cryo-probe located
at Biqualys (Wageningen, The Netherlands). Chemical shifts are expressed
in ppm relative to internal TMSP at 0.00 ppm. 1D and 2D
COSY, TOCSY, HMBC, and HSQC spectra were acquired using standard
pulse sequences delivered by Bruker. For the 1H COSY spectra,
400 experiments of 2 scans (0.5 h), 400 experiments of 4 scans
(1.25 h) and 512 experiments of 4 scans (1.5 h) were recorded for
samples CI, CII, and EII, respectively. For the 1H TOCSY spectra
400  4 (1 h), 400  8 (2 h) and 512  8 (2.5 h) scans were recorded
for samples CI, CII and EII, respectively. The mixing time
for the TOCSY spectra was 100 ms. For the [1H,13C]-HMBC spectra
880  24 (10.5 h), 800  112 (44.5 h), and 880  96 (42 h) scans
were recorded and for the [1H,13C]-HSQC spectra these values were
512  4 (1.25 h), 512  16 (5 h), and 512  24 (7.5 h) for samples
CI, CII, and EII, respectively. Chemical shifts derived from 1D data
are given in three decimals. Data from 2D spectra with lower resolution
are given in two decimals or 1 decimal in case of severe
overlap of signals.
2.9. Labeling of oligosaccharides by reductive amination
Oligosaccharides were labeled at their reducing end to facilitate
characterization by ESI-MS. Samples (5–500 lg DM depending on
the purity/composition of the sample) were dried after which
50 lL ethyl-4-aminobenzoate (ABEE) (Acros organics, Geel, Belgium)(
0.4 M in 15% (v/v) HOAc/ 85% (v/v) MeOH) and 50 lL 2-picoline
borane complex (Sigma–Aldrich) (0.9 M in MeOH) was
added. Subsequently, samples were incubated at 65 C for 2 h after
which 300–500 lL water was added causing (partly) precipitation
of both ABEE and 2-picoline borane followed by centrifugation
(12,000g, 5 min), at 7 C. In the case that oligosaccharides were
only reduced the same procedure was used without adding ABEE
to the 15% (v/v) HOAc/85% (v/v) MeOH solution. Analyses of the labeled
or reduced oligosaccharides were performed on reversed
phase UHPLC-UV-ESI-MS as described above.
