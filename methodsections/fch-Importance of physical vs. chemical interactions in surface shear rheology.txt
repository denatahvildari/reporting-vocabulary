 2. Materials and methods
2.1. Chemicals
S-Acetylmercaptosuccinic anhydride (S-AMSA), Orthophthaldialdehyde
(OPA), 2-Ethyl-5-phenylisoxazolium-3V-sulfonate
(Woodward’s reagent K) and 2-(N-morpholino)-ethanesulfonic
acid (MES) buffer were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich.
N,N-dimethyl-2-mercaptoethyl-ammoniumchloride (DMA)
and di-sodiumtetraborate decahydrate (Borax) were purchased
from Merck. Sodiumdodecylsulfate (SDS) was from Serva. All
chemicals used were of analytical grade.
2.2. Introduction of sulfhydryl groups into ovalbumin
Chicken egg ovalbumin was purified (>98%) as described
previously [37]. Primary amino groups in ovalbumin were
thiolated essentially as described by Klotz [38]. In this method
S-acetylmercaptosuccinic anhydride (S-AMSA) is covalently
linked to lysine residues on the protein surface. The modification
was performed as follows: 200 mL of a 25 mg/mL
ovalbumin (0.55 mM) solution in demineralized water was
adjusted to pH 8.0 by the addition of 1 M NaOH using a pHstat
titration equipment (Metrohm) at room temperature. The
reagent (S-AMSA) was added to the protein solution in small
aliquots, while the pH was kept at 8.0 (T0.1) by the addition of
1 M NaOH using the pH-stat apparatus. Two batches of
modified ovalbumin were prepared by a total addition of 28.5
and 97.5 mg S-AMSA respectively to obtain a low and a
medium degree of modification. After addition, the solution
was stirred for another 30 min., followed by extensive dialysis
against demineralized water at 4 -C. After dialysis each batch
was separated into two fractions. To one fraction, 125 mL 0.01
M hydroxylamine (pH 7.3) was added, to remove the acetyl
blocks. To the other fraction 125 mL distilled water was added
to keep concentrations in both solutions equal. The deblocked
fraction was then dialyzed against distilled water; both samples
were frozen, but not freeze-dried in order to avoid oxidation of
the free sulfhydryl groups. The material was stored at 20 -C
until use.
2.3. Chemical characterization
2.3.1. Degree of modification
The total number of active sulfhydryl groups in nonmodified,
blocked and deblocked ovalbumin was determined
using the Ellmann protocol [39]. The reagent, 5,5V-dithiobis(2-
nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB), reacts with free thiol groups of
the protein. The reagent solution was prepared by dissolving
4.8 mg DTNB in 1.0 mL, 10 mM Tris–HCl buffer (pH 8.0
and 2% SDS) and subsequent addition of 2.5 mL Tris–HCl
buffer (10 mM, pH 8.0). 50 AL DTNB solution was added to
250 AL 5 mg/mL protein solution. The solution was mixed
and incubated for 20 min at 25 -C; then the absorbance was
measured at 412 nm. The calibration curve, obtained by using
various dilutions of a 0.50 mM cysteine solution, provided
an extinction coefficient for the reduced conjugate of
13425 M1 cm1.
2.3.2. Reactivity of sulfhydryl groups
The chemical reactivity of the blocked and deblocked
proteins was measured using the sulfhydryl–disulphide exchange
index (SEI) as described by Owusu-Arpenten et al.
[40]. The method determines both the number of available
–SH groups and the reactivity of these groups. The method is
based on the reaction between 2,2V-dipyridyldisulphide (PDS)
and a free –SH group. The formation of the reaction product
(2-thiopyridine; 2-TP) can be followed in time by measuring
the absorbance at 343 nm. A stock solution of PDS was
prepared by dissolving 40 mg PDS in 40 mL phosphate buffer
(10 mM pH 7.0) and stirring for 3 h at 20 -C. Then the solution
was filtered over a 0.45 Am filter and the concentration of PDS
was determined at 281 nm, using a molar extinction coefficient
of 9730 M1 cm1 [40]. For measurements the stock was
diluted to 5I105 M; 2.7 mL of this solution was added to a
cuvette and the absorbance at 343 was measured. Then 0.3 mL
of sample solution was added and the adsorbance at 343 nm
followed in time. Sample solutions used were 10 mg/mL
protein (in 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.0); Glutathion
(0.1 mg/mL in 0.01 N HCl) was used for calibration. The total
number of reactive –SH groups was calculated from the
plateau value of the adsorbance (using a molar extinction
coefficient of 7076 M1 cm1) [40]. The rate constant (k –SH)
of this second-order reaction was calculated from the slope of
the graph of the right-hand side of Eq. (1) against time.

When this rate constant is divided by the rate constant of
glutathion, a standardized value called the SEI index is
obtained; SEI=(k –SH/ kglutathion)*100%.
2.3.3. Detection of quaternary structure
Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) was used to study the
aggregation state of the proteins. SEC was carried out on a
Superdex S200 HR column (Pharmacia Biotech) with a bed
volume of 24 mL. The column was equilibrated and run with
10 mM phosphate-buffer pH 7.0 and 50 mM NaCl at 20 -C.
The sample (200 AL, 5 mg/mL in the same buffer) was applied
to the column and the flow-rate was set to 0.4 mL/min;
detection took place at 280 nm.

2.3.4. Evaluation of secondary structure
Far-UV circular dichroism (CD) spectra of 0.1 mg/mL
protein solutions in 10 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) were
recorded at 20 -C in the range from 190 to 260 nm with a
spectral resolution of 0.2 nm, on a Jasco J715-spectropolarimeter.
The scan speed was 100 nm/min and the response time
was 0.125 s with a bandwidth of 1 nm. Quartz cells with an
optical path of 0.1 cm were used. Typically, 16 scans were
accumulated and averaged. The spectra were corrected for the
corresponding protein-free sample.
2.3.5. Evaluation of tertiary structure
The intrinsic fluorescence of the tryptophan and tyrosine
residues of 0.1 mg/mL protein solutions in 10 mM phosphate
buffer (pH 7.0) were measured on a Perkin Elmer Luminescence
Spectrometer LS 50 B. The excitation and emission slits
were set at 5 nm. The excitation wavelength was 295 or 274
nm, the excitation maxima of tryptophan and tyrosine
respectively. The emission spectra were recorded from 300 to
450 nm with a scan speed of 120 nm/min. Each spectrum was
the average of two scans and corrected for a protein-free
sample.
2.3.6. Iso-electric focusing
The iso-electric points (IEP) of non-modified and modified
ovalbumin variants were determined using the Phast System
(Pharmacia). Ready to use PhastGel IEF 3-9 gels were used,
which were stained with Coomassie brilliant blue. A calibration
kit from Pharmacia was used with proteins that have isoelectric
points ranging from 3.5 to 9.3.
2.3.7. Protein aggregation in solution
The chemical reactivity of the modified ovalbumin variants
in bulk solution was tested under similar conditions as
experienced at the interface by concentrating protein solutions
to final concentrations of 100 or 200 mg/mL (using Centriprep
centrifugal filtration units from Millipore). Further experiments
were performed by heating 0.1 mg/mL protein solutions
at 90 -C for 30 min, or by addition of ferricyanide. Any
aggregation induced by these treatments was analysed with
sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(SDS-PAGE), SDS-PAGE 8-25 gradient gels (Pharmacia)
were run on a Phast-System (Pharmacia). Samples were
dissolved in sample buffer, containing 62.5 mM Tris–HCl
(pH 6.8), 1.25% SDS, 5% glycerol, 0.00125% bromophenol
blue in the presence or absence of 1.25% h-mercaptoethanol,
and heated for 10 min at 100 -C before analysis. Gels were
stained with Coomassie brilliant blue. A calibration kit with
low molecular mass markers ranging from 14 to 94 kDa from
Pharmacia was used.
2.4. Surface shear rheology
To study interfacial shear properties of adsorbed protein
layers a Couette-type surface shear rheometer was used as
described by Martin et al. [41]. The apparatus is schematically
drawn in Fig. 1. First, 279 mL buffer (10 mM phosphate, pH
7.0, containing 300 mM NaCl) was filtered over a 0.2 Am
filter and then placed in the trough. A concentrated protein
solution (4 mL) was injected under the interface using a
syringe, to obtain a final protein concentration of 0.1 mg/mL.
A stainless steel biconical disk (diameter 30 mm) was
suspended from a torsion wire of 0.15 mm and placed in
such a way that the disc edge was exactly at the air–water
interface. The solution was left to adsorb and equilibrate for
22 h while the surface tension was measured with a Wilhelmy
plate (perimeter 18.1 mm) suspended from a NIMA tensiometer
as illustrated in Fig. 1.
In replicate measurements with and without the Wilhelmy
plate at the interface it was found that the presence of the plate  did not affect the results from the surface shear measurements.
Stress–strain curves were made as a function of time by
rotating the sample dish at a fixed rate during 30 min. The
stress acting on the inner disc (r  [mN/m]) resulted in rotation
of this disc that was quantified by reading the reflection of a
laser beam from a mirror on top of the inner disk on a circular
scale with a radius of 600 mm. Assuming homogenous
deformation of the surface layer the strain (c  [ ]) applied
can be calculated by Eq. (2) [42] :

 Where Ri  is the radius [m] and Hi  is the rotational
displacement [rad] of the inner disc, and Ro  and ho  are the
radius and rotational displacement of the outer dish; Ho  is
given by the angular velocity of the trough and the time
(x *t) and Hi  is measured from the displacement of the
reflected laser light on the circular scale divided by two times
the radius of the scale. The stress on the interface is calculated
from Eq. (3):

 with s  =KHi  as the torque [Nm] exerted on the disc, and K  as
the torsion wire constant. The torsion wire constant was
determined by measuring the oscillation time with a calibration
weight of 75 g, which is close to the weight of the  pendulum disc. Values for the system parameters are:
x =1.27I 103  m, Ri =1.50I 102  m, Ro =7.25I 102  m,
K  =1.73 I 105  N m rad1 , the radius of the scale is 0.6 m.
All experiments were performed at 20 - C. Duplicate
measurements were performed after thorough cleaning of
the trough by starting with new buffer and new injection of
the protein solution.
