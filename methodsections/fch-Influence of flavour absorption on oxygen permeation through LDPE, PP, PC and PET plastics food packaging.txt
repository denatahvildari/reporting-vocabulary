Materials and methodsMaterialsThe polymer packaging materials used were lowdensitypolyethylene (LDPE; LDPE 300R; thickness100 mm; Dow Benelux NV, Terneuzen, TheNetherlands), oriented polypropylene (PP; Bicor1MB200; 30 mm; Mobil Plastics Europe, Kerkrade,The Netherlands), polycarbonate (PC; Lexan18B35; 75 mm; General Electric Plastics, Bergen opZoom, The Netherlands) and polyethylene terephthalate(PET; Melinex1 800; 12 mm; DuPont TeijinFilms, Luxembourg).Decanal and 2-nonanone were purchased fromMerck, hexyl acetate from Aldrich and (+)-limonenefrom Sigma. Tween 80 from Merck was used as anemulsi®er to disperse the ¯avour compounds in anaqueous phase. Selection of the aroma compoundswas based on diOEerences in functional groups, polarityand absorption a nity by the diOEerent polymers.Characteristics of the ¯avour compounds are listed intable 1. Log P represents the hydrophobicity of a¯avour compound; a higher log P means a morehydrophobic compound.Preparation of ¯avour model solutionsA ¯avour model solution was prepared in a stopperedconical ¯ask by dispersing the aroma compounds(100 ml l 1 each) in 4 g l 1 aqueous Tween 80. Each¯avour compound was added using a micropipet(Micropipette) equipped with a glass capillary tube(Socorex, Lausanne, Switzerland). An Ultra Turrax T25 (IKA-Labortechnik, Staufen, Germany) wasused for homogenization for 2min at 9500 rpm, followedby equilibration overnight in the dark at 40°C.Exposure conditionsEach polymer specimen (11 11 cm) was bent andstapled together with two galvanized staples. Four ofthe stapled polymer specimens were fully immersed in1 litre of an equilibrated model solution containingone or more ¯avour compounds and incubated in thedark at 40°C. Polymer samples immersed in Tween 80model solution without ¯avour compounds were usedas a blank. DiOEerent exposure times were used toachieve diOEerent absorbed ¯avour quantities in thepolymers. After exposure, a polymer sample wasremoved from the model solution, rinsed with ethanolfor 10 s and thoroughly wiped with paper tissue toremove excess of the model solution. Polymer sampleswere divided into two parts. One part was analysedfor absorbed ¯avour compounds using a large volumeinjection gas chromatography (LVI-GC) ultrasonic`in vial’ extraction method. The other part of thesample was placed in a permeation cell to measure theoxygen permeability.LVI-GC `in-vial’ extraction of the polymer stripsStrips of LDPE (1.5 2.0 cm), PP (1.5 2.0 cm), PC(1.5 11.0 cm) and PET (3.0 11.0 cm) were cut insmall pieces and immediately placed into a 10-ml vialcontaining 5ml n-hexane (Enviroscan, Labscan,Dublin, Ireland). The vials were tightly closed witha Te¯on silicone seal and an aluminium crimp cap.In-vial extraction was carried out for 60min in anultrasonic bath (Ultrawave, CardiOE, UK). Longerultrasonic treatment did not achieve better extraction.GC analysis was performed using a LVI-GC system(Ultra TraceTM) (Interscience, Breda, TheNetherlands). The background of this technique andequipment used have been described by van Willigeet al. (2000a). The following LVI-GC parameterswere kept constant for all hexane extracts: helium ascarrier gas at a constant ¯ow of 2.3ml min 1; FIDdetector temperature at 290°C; solvent vapour exit(SVE) temperature at 200°C; oven temperature programmefrom 50°C (held 10min) at a rate of5°C min 1 to 150°C and further at a rate of25°C min 1 to 280°C (held 5min).The conditions for the LDPE, PP or PC hexaneextracts were: injection volume 30 ml, injection speed5 ml s 1, SVE delay time and secondary cooling time11 s. The conditions for the PET hexane extracts were:injection volume 200 ml, injection speed 2 ml s 1, SVEdelay time and secondary cooling time 50 s.Calibration curves …r2 > 0:997† were established foreach component with the external standard method.Determination of oxygen permeabilityTo measure the oxygen permeability of the exposedpolymer specimens a set-up based on the isostaticcontinuous ¯ow technique was developed (®gure 1).In the isostatic method, the pressure diOEerentialacross the test ®lm remains constant during the totalpermeation process. Whereas the high-pressure side(oxygen chamber) remains constant at a certain value,the low-pressure side (nitrogen chamber) is maintainedby sweeping the permeated molecules by a continuous ¯ow of carrier gas (Hernandez andGavara 1999).A stainless steel two-chamber permeation cell wasmaintained in a temperature-controlled cabinet at25 0:1°C. O-rings were used to ensure airtightness.To remove oxygen, both chambers and polymer ®lmwere ¯ushed with dry nitrogen 5.0 (Hoekloos,Schiedam, The Netherlands) for 20min. The ¯ow ratewas maintained at a constant ¯ow of 1.5 l h 1 usingcalibrated mass ¯ow controllers from BrooksInstruments (Veenendaal, The Netherlands). Initialtime was marked when the oxygen 2.5 (Hoekloos) gasstream started to ¯ow through the oxygen chamber.The amount of oxygen permeated per unit time wasmonitored continuously for 30 min, which was su -cient to reach a maximum permeation. Oxygen concentrationswere measured with a Xentra 4100 GasPurity Analyser (Servomex, Zoetermeer, TheNetherlands) equipped with a Zirconia O2 measuringcell. The gas analyser was calibrated periodicallyusing oxygen±nitrogen mixtures with accuratelyknown oxygen content. Preliminary experimentsshowed that due to the high operation temperatureof the Zirconia measuring cell ( 750°C), burning ofdesorbed ¯avour compounds occurred, consequentlydecreasing the oxygen readings. Therefore, tubes ®lledwith Tenax1-TA absorbance (Alltech, Zoetermeer,The Netherlands) were placed between the permeationcell and the gas analyser to prevent enteringdesorbed ¯avour compounds into the Zirconia measuringcell. Equal pressure between the two chamberswas maintained by placing also Tenax tubes at theexit of the oxygen chamber. The permeability coe -cient P was determined directly from the maximumby: where Fmax is the maximum ¯ow of the oxygen(quantity per time), l is the ®lm thickness, A is thearea of the ®lm exposed to oxygen and p is thedriving force or gas pressure gradient through the ®lm(Hernandez et al. 1986). The permeability coe cientis based on two fundamental mass-transfer parameters:the diOEusion and solubility coe cient. ThediOEusion coe cient D is a measure for the rate ofpenetrant molecules moving through the barrier, inthe direction of lower concentration or partial pressure.Pasternak et al. (1970) presented an equation todetermine the diOEusion coe cient (D) from the unsteadystate portion of the permeation curve: where Ft is the oxygen ¯ow at time t and X ˆ l2=4Dt.The mathematical method of Newton±Raphson wasused to evaluate X as a function of time. The diOEusioncoe cient is determined from the slope of 1/X versus tfor values within the range 0:05 < Ft=Fmax < 0:95(Hernandez et al. 1986). The solubility coe cient Sdescribes the amount of the transferring moleculesretained or dissolved in the ®lm at equilibrium conditions.When Henry’s law of solubility holds, thesolubility coe cient S can be calculated from:Desorption of ¯avour compounds from PP ®lmDuring all oxygen permeability measurements desorptionof ¯avour compounds from the plastic ®lmsoccurred. The rate of ¯avour desorption from PP ®lmwas investigated after 3 days of exposure to the¯avour model solution at 40°C. Preliminary experimentsshowed that PP reached an absorption equilibriumafter 3 days. After 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 90and 120 min, the oxygen permeability experiment wasstopped and the ®lm removed from the permeationcell. Two strips (1:5 2:0 cm) were cut from thecentre of the ®lm to analyse the amount of ¯avourcompounds left.
