2. Materials and methods
2.1. Substrates
The different substrates used within this study were obtained
by enzymatic liquefaction of apple (MHRa and MHRB), carrot
(MHRC), and potato (MHRP) according to Schols and Voragen.19
All MHR samples were prepared using an experimental enzyme
preparation called Rapidase C600 except for MHRB which was produced
using Rapidase liq+. Both enzymes were obtained from DSM
Food Specialties, Delft, the Netherlands.
2.2. Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs)
Different MAbs were used to detect pectic structures after chromatographic
separation. Arabinogalactan type I (AG I) was detected
using LM5,20 arabinan side chains were detected using
LM6,21 Arabinogalactan type II (AG II) was detected using LM2,22
and homogalacturonan (HG) was detected using JIM 7 toward partially
methyl esterified HG.23
2.3. Analytical methods
2.3.1. Sugar composition
Sugar compositions were determined using methanolysis followed
by TFA hydrolysis according to de Ruiter et al.,24 and were
analyzed on a Dionex HPAEC system according to Verhoef et al.25
2.4. Linkage analyses
Linkage analyses were performed according to the Hakomori
procedure.26 Prior to permethylation of the different MHR samples,
their uronic acid moieties were converted to their neutral sugar
analogue and subsequently labeled at C-6 by deuterium according
to Taylor and Conrad27 modified by Kim and Carpita and Sims and
Basic.28,29
The partly methylated alditol acetates were further analyzed by
GC-FID and GC-MS according to Verhoef et al.25
2.5. Weak anion exchange chromatography
MHR samples (250 lL; 5 mg/mL) were separated and fractionated
on a Dionex PropacTM WAX-10 column (250  4 mm) according
to Guillotin et al.30 using a Akta Purifier (GE Healthcare).
Separation was monitored using UV 210 nm absorption, and fractions
of 0.5 mL were collected in 96-well plates. The fractions were
subsequently pooled for sugar composition analysis or further analyzed
using ELISA detection with MAbs against different pectic
epitopes.
2.6. HPSEC
High performance size exclusion chromatography was performed
on a ThermoQuest HPLC using a series of three TosoHaas
TSK-Gel G columns (4000PWXL, 3000PWXL, 2500PWXL). Samples
(100 lL; 5 mg/mL) were separated at 30 C using a 50 mM ammonium
formiate buffer (pH 5.1) at 0.8 mL/min as eluent. Separation
was monitored using a refractive index (RI) detector, and 0.5 mL
fractions were collected in 96-well plates. The fractions were subsequently
pooled for sugar composition analysis or further analyzed
using MAb assays.
2.7. Source 15Q separation
MHRB was subjected to preparative separation based on their
charge distribution using a Source 15Q column (115  60 mm,
325 mL). MHRB (0.5 g) in 100 mL was applied to the column at
25 mL/min. The sample was eluted off the column at 50 mL/min
using a linear gradient from 0 to 600 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.
The gradient was applied using the following steps: 0–120 mM
in 13 column volumes (CVs); 120–420 mM in 44 CVs; 420–
600 mM in 2 CVs. Finally the column was washed with 8 CVs
600 mM phosphate buffer followed by 1 M NaOH (5 CVs). Fractions
of 250 mL were collected using a SuperFrac fraction collector (GE
healthcare). The elution profile was visualized using both UV
210 nm absorption and the neutral and uronic acid content of each
fraction. Both neutral sugars and uronic acid were measured simultaneously
using an automated colorimetric orcinol31 and mhydroxydiphenyl
assay,32,33 respectively.
2.8. ELISA assays
Enzyme-Linked Immuno Sorbent Assay (ELISA) was used to detect
the different pectic structures present within each of the fractions.
An aliquot of each fraction (20 lL) was diluted 10 using
0.01 M Phosphate Buffer Saline (PBS), pH 7.4, in an immunosorb
96-well plate (Maxisorb, F96, NUNC). The diluted fractions were allowed
to coat to the plates overnight at 4 C. After coating the plates
were rinsed with tap water followed by blocking for 1 h at 4 C using
200 lL PBS containing 3% (w/v) nonfat bovine milk powder (Sigma).
After exhaustive washing with tap water, 100 lL primary antibody
(10 diluted in PBS) was added and incubated for 2 h at room temperature.
Again the plates were washed, and 100 lL of anti-rat IgG
coupled to horseradish peroxidase (HRP, Sigma), 1000-fold dilution
in PBS containing 1% (w/v) milk powder, was added and incubated
for 1 h followed by another washing step.
The plates were developed by adding 150 lL 3,30,5,50-tetramethylbenzidine
liquid substrate (Sigma). The reaction was
stopped by adding 30 lL of 2M H2SO4, resulting in the formation
of a yellow color measured at 450 nm with a lQuant Microbiology
ELISA reader.
2.9. Radial Yariv gel diffusion
Detection of AGII was performed by applying 8 lL MHR solution
(3 mg/mL) to an 1% agarose gel with 0.15 MNaCl and 0.03 g/L Yariv
phenylglycoside according to van Holst and Clarke.34 After leaving
the gel with the samples overnight the formed halo was compared
to a calibration series of gum Arabic ranging from 0.1 to 2.5 mg/mL.
The Yariv phenylglycoside was prepared as described by Yariv
et al.35 Yariv phenylglycoside positive material was precipitated
from MHRC according to Immerzeel et al.14
