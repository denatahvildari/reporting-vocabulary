# reporting-vocabulary

In this work we developed a vocabualry for reporting a sceintific experimental method and materials. The particular domain is food scinece
we modeled the knowlede for reproting the column chromatography experiment. 
The knoweldge acquisition methodology is expert-based. We used ROC+ tool for this end. 10 domain experts in teams of two charted the needed 
and sufficient (efficieny was considered by the domain expert) information about the mentioned laboratory method. To evaluate the coverage of the 
domain knowledg, we constrcuted a corpus and checked the occurrence of the vocabualry in the descriptions of this method. 

The description are extracted from journal papers in the domain of food chemistry, food microbiology, and food physics. 

This repository contains:

1. the created corpus,
2. list of the articles and the corresponding journals, 
3. the created vocabualry in rdf format,
4. the R code for checking the occurrences of the vocabualry,
