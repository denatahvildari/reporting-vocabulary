High performance anion-exchange chromatography with
pulsed amperometric detection
An HPAEC system (ICS-3000, Dionex Corporation, Sunnyvale,
CA, USA) was equipped with a CarboPac PA-1 column and a
CarboPac PA-1 guard column (2 mm ID  250 mm and 2 mm
ID  25 mm; Dionex Corporation). A flow of 0.3 mL/min was used
and the temperature was kept at 20 C. AOS (injection volume
10 lL; 10???100 lg/mL) were separated using a gradient with
0.1 M NaOH (solution A) and 1 M NaOAc in 0.1 M NaOH (solution
B): 0???36 min from 0% B to 42% B, 36???42 min at 100% B, and 42???
57 min at 0% B.6
