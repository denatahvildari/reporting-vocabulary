High-performance size exclusion chromatography
(HPSEC) was carried out in a ThermoFinnigan
(United States) HPLC apparatus with three TSKgel
columns (7.8-mm i.d. 3  30 cm per column) in series
(G4000PWXL , G3000 PWXL , and G2500PWXL , Tosohaas,
Japan), in combination with a PWXL -guard
column (Tosohaas). Elution took place at 30 8 C with
0.2 M sodium nitrate at a flow rate of 0.8 mL/min
and was monitored with a refractive-index detector
(Spectra System RI 150, Thermo Electron Corp.,
Italy). The software ChromQuest was obtained
from ThermoFinnigan.12
