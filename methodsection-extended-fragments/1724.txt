Gel permeation chromatography (GPC)
Oligomers were analyzed in a Viscotek GPCmax VE
2001 system fitted with a Viscotek internal pump
and a Viscotek TDA 302 triple detector array for
refraction index and viscosity detection. An external
Waters Lambda max UV detector at 230 nm was
also used. The data were recorded on an Omnisec
4.5 station. The products were separated with MZGel
SD  Plus series columns of 50 ?? , 100 ?? , 1000 ??
and 10,000 ?? operating at 40 o C. Samples of 150 ?? L
were eluted with chloroform at 1 mL.min 1 . The
average molecular weight was calibrated using a
standard mixture of polystyrene.
