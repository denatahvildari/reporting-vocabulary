Isolation and characterization of endogalactanase. E. coli cells containing the
galA gene were grown overnight at 37°C (1 liter) and harvested by centrifugation
(15 min, 8,000  g, 4°C). The supernatant was used for activity measurement,
and the cells were suspended in 90 ml 50 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 5, and
disrupted by sonic treatment (10 min; amplitude, 30%; duty cycle, 0.3 s on and
0.7 s off; Digital Sonifier; Branson, Danbury, CT) on ice. Subsequently, the
suspension was centrifuged (15 min, 8,000  g, 4°C), the cell extract was collected,
the pellet was suspended in 40 ml 50 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5),
and a second sonic treatment was performed. This step was repeated twice. The
cell extracts were pooled and applied onto a Q-Sepharose (Amersham, Little
Chalfont, United Kingdom) anion-exchange column, using a BioPilot pump
system (Amersham). Elution was done with a linear gradient of 0 to 0.5 M NaCl
in 50 mM sodium acetate, pH 5, at a flow rate of 57 cm/h. Fractions with the
highest endogalactanase activity were pooled and further purified on a Superdex
200 PG (Amersham) size exclusion column. Elution was performed with 0.15 M
NaCl in 20 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, at a flow rate of 76 cm/h.
Fractions with the highest endogalactanase activity were pooled and concentrated
with anion-exchange chromatography under the same conditions as described
above. The mode of action of GalA was determined by high-performance anionexchange
chromatography (HPAEC) and high-performance size exclusion chromatography
(HPSEC). The incubations were performed in triplicate with 5
mg/ml potato galactan in 5 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, and 3.3 U/ml
enzyme at 37°C for different time intervals. The incubations were stopped by
heating the incubation mixtures for 10 min at 100°C. After centrifugation (10 min, 10,000  g), the supernatant was analyzed by HPAEC, HPSEC, and the Nelson-Somogyi method.The substrate specificity was also measured by HPAEC in triplicate. Theincubations were performed with 1 mg/ml substrate in 45 mM sodium acetatebuffer, pH 5.0, and 0.067 U/ml enzyme at 37°C for 30 and 120 min. The incubationswere stopped and analyzed as described above.The influence of arabinosyl side chains on the hydrolytic activity of GalA wasmeasured by HPAEC. The incubations were performed with 5 mg/ml potatogalactan in 5 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, and 13.6 U/ml arabinofuranosidaseat 30°C for 24 h. The incubations were stopped by heating the incubationmixtures for 10 min at 100°C. After cooling to 37°C, 3.3 U/ml GalA was addedand the samples were incubated at 37°C for 48 h. The incubations were stoppedand analyzed as described above. All reactions were carried out in triplicate.Analytical methods. HPAEC was performed using a Thermo-Quest highperformanceliquid chromatography system equipped with a Dionex CarboPacPA-1 (4 mm ID by 250 mm) column in combination with a CarboPac PA guardcolumn (3 mm ID by 25 mm) and a Dionex ED40 PAD detector (Dionex Co.,Sunnyvale). A flow rate of 1 ml/min was used with the following gradient ofsodium acetate in 0.1 M NaOH: 0 to 40 min, 0 to 400 mM; 40 to 41 min, 400 to1,000 mM. Each elution was followed by a washing step for 5 min with 1,000 mMsodium acetate in 0.1MNaOH and an equilibration step of 15 min 0.1MNaOH.HPSEC was performed on three TSKgel columns (7.8 mm ID by 30 cm percolumn) in series (G4000 PWXL, G3000 PWXL, G2500 PWXL; Tosohaas,Stuttgart, Germany), in combination with a PWX-guard column (Tosohaas).Elution took place at 30°C with 0.2 M sodium nitrate at 0.8 ml/min. The eluatewas monitored by refractive index detection using a Shodex RI-72 detector(Kawasaki, Japan). Calibration was performed using dextrans (Amersham).For matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization–time of flight mass spectrometry(MALDI-TOF MS), an Ultraflex workstation (Bruker Daltronics GmbH,Germany) was used. The mass spectrometer was calibrated with a mixture ofmaltodextrins. The samples were mixed with a matrix solution (1 l each). Thematrix solution was prepared by dissolving 9 mg of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid and3 mg 1-hydroxyisoquinoline in a 1-ml mixture of acetonitrile and water (3:7). Theprepared sample and matrix solutions were put on a gold plate and dried undera stream of warm air.
