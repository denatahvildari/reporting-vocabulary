For a detailed characterization, the enzymes were further purified. Abf3 and Abn7 (EC 3.2.1.55) were purified by using anion exchange chromatography on a Akta purifier system equipped with a SP Sepharose fast flow column (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden). The eluate was monitored at 280 and 214 nm. Proteins were dialyzed against 20mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5. The column was equilibrated using the same buffer, and the proteins applied onto the column were eluted using a linear gradient of 0???0.5MNaCl within a 20mMsodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5. Fractions were collected and tested for enzymatic activity on WAX. The active fractions were pooled and applied onto a Superdex 200 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden), previously equilibrated with 20mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 6.5. Fractions were collected and characterized using SDS???PAGE and tested for WAX degrading activity. The active fractions were pooled and stored in small aliquots at ???20 ???C.
