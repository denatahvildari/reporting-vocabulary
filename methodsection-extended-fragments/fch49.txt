The fatty acid methylesters were separated by gas chromatography (6890 N GC-system from Agilent Technologies, Inc, Santa Clara, CA, USA), using a 25 m WCOT fused silica column (inside diameter 0.25 mm)coated with 0.2 mmCPWax 58 (Chrompack, Middelburg, The Netherlands). The carrier gas was hydrogen gas and 0.5 ml sample was splitless injected at a temperature of 275 C. The initial temperature and time were 60 C and 1.5 min, respectively. The temperature was increased as follows: 30 C/min until 180 C, 1.2 C/min until 215 C, and 40 C/min tot 275 C. The concentrations of fatty acids were calculated in relation to the internal standard (C17).
