RP-UHPLC analysis
Samples were analysed on a Thermo Accela UHPLC system (San Jose, CA, USA) equipped with pump, autosampler and PDA detector. Samples (1mL) were injected on a Waters
Acquity UPLC BEH shield RP18 column (2.1150mm,
1.7mmparticle size) with a Waters Acquity UPLC shield RP18
Vanguard pre-column (2.15 mm, 1.7mm particle size;
Waters, Milford, MA, USA). Water acidified with 0.1% (v/
v) acetic acid, eluent A, and ACN acidified with 0.1% (v/v)
acetic acid, eluent B, were used as eluents. The flow rate was
300 mL min 1, the column oven temperature was controlled at
258C, and the PDA detector was set to measure the range
200???400 nm. The following elution profile was used: 0???2 min,
linear gradient from 10%???25% (v/v) B; 2???9 min, linear
gradient from 25%???50% (v/v) B; 9???12 min, isocratic on 50%
B; 12???22 min, linear gradient from 50%???100% (v/v) B;
22???25 min, isocratic on 100% B; 25???27 min, linear gradient
from 100%???10% (v/v) B; 27???29 min, isocratic on 10% (v/v) B.
Most settings were optimised via automatic tuning
using ???Tune Plus??? (Xcalibur 2.07, Thermo Scientific). To this
end, the system was tuned with genistein in both positive
ionisation (PI) and negative ionisation (NI) mode. For both
modes, the ion transfer tube temperature was 3508C and the
source voltage 4.8 kV. Data acquisition and reprocessing were
done with Xcalibur 2.07 (Thermo Scientific).
