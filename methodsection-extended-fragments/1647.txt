The treatment of samples and analysis of monosaccharides,
organic acids, alcohols and polyols were performed by
High-Pressure Liquid Chromatography as described earlier
[14 ]. The cell dry weight determination was performed by
W ltration of fermentation broth over a pre-weighed W lter
and drying overnight [14 ]. The ammonium concentration in
fermentation samples was analysed with an Ammonium
Test (Spectroquant, Merck, Germany). The chiral purity
(%) of lactic acid was determined by derivatisation of all
lactates using methanol, after which both enantiomers of
methyl lactate were separated on a chiral Gas Chromatography
column and detected using a Flame Ionisation
Detector. The chiral purity was expressed as the area of
the main enantiomer divided by the sum of areas of both
enantiomers.
