The total lipid fraction was derivatized by mild alkaline methanolysis to
obtain fatty acid methyl esters (FAME). Both C12:0 and
C19:0 were used as internal FAME standards. Identification
of the fatty acids was done using equivalent chain length data
with known standards measured on a non-polar column.
Additional identification was done using GC/MS. Carbon
isotopic composition of individual FAME was determined
with a gas-chromatograph combustion-interface isotoperatio
mass spectrometer (GC-c-IRMS); a HP G1530 GC
(Hewlett Packard) connected to Delta-plus IRMS via a type-
III combustion interface from Thermo Finnigan (Bremen).
Helium was used as a carrier gas (150 kPa) with an apolar
column (Hewlett-Packard HP-5MS, 60 m*0.32 mm
*0.25 l m). The column was kept at 70 C for 2 min, then
temperature was programed from 70 to 150 C at 20 C
min-1 , subsequently from 150 to 290 C at 3 C min-1  and
from 290 C to 325 C at 5 C min-1 , temperature was kept at
325 C for 11 min. Fatty acid concentrations were determined
by area correction according to the C19:0 internal
standard. Stable carbon isotope ratios (13 C/12 C) for individual
FAwere calculated fromFAME data by correcting for
the one carbon atom in the methyl group that was added
during derivatization (Middelburg et al. 2000 ).
