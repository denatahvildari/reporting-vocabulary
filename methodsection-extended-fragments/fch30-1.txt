\f0\fs24 \cf0 Anion Exchange Chromatography (HPAEC) system (Sunnyvale, CA,\
USA), with pulsed amperometric detection. Samples were diluted\
500  with water before analysis and 20 lL was injected into the\
system. Separation was achieved using a CarboPac PA-1 column\
(2  250 mm) preceded by a CarboPac PA-1 guard column\
(2  250 mm). The monomers in the samples were eluted with a\
gradient of 0.02\'960.05 M NaOH for 3 min and 0.05\'960.075 M NaOH\
for 10 min, followed by isocratic elution of 0.1 M NaOH for 2 min.\
Subsequently, the column was washed with 1 M NaOAc in 0.1 M\
NaOH for 7 min. Equilibration of the column was achieved in\
0.1 M NaOH for 3 min followed by 0.02 M NaOH for 20 min.\
Furfural and 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furfural (5-HMF), by-products\
which can be formed when respectively hexoses and pentoses are\
degraded, were determined by HPLC using an Aminex HPX-87H\
column and UV-/RI-detection (280 nm) in soluble hydrolysates\
from pretreated wheat bran. Acrylamide, which is formed in an\
advanced Maillard reaction from aspartic acid, was measured in\
the untreated wheat bran and in the four samples pretreated at\
180 C. Acrylamide was quantified by LC\'96MS/MS with positive\
electrospray ionization using an Applied Biosystem API 4000 triple\
quadrupole mass spectrometer (Darmstadt, Germany) coupled to\
an Agilent 1100 LC system (Waldbronn, Germany), as previously\
described by Hoenicke and Gatermann (2005). The degree of\
browning of the samples, as a measure of melanoidin formation,\
was determined by liberation of brown pigments from protein\
molecules by means of the proteolytic enzyme pronase according\
to the method of Palombo et al. (1984).\
The digestibility of proteins in the pretreated samples was assessed\
in vitro by subsequent incubation with pepsin (at pH 1)\
and pancreatin (at pH 6.8) according to the method of Babinszky\
et al. (1990).\
All analyses were performed in duplicate, apart from amino acid\
and OMIU-reactive lysine analyses which were performed in\
triplicate.\
