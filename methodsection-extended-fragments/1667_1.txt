The derivatized HA-fluor products were purified in three separation
steps on an .KTA explorer fast protein liquid chromatography
(FPLC) system monitoring the eluents at 215 and 340 nm: (i)
desalting the derivatized oligosaccharides with a Sephadex G10
column and 50 mM ammonium acetate as eluent, (ii) separating
the fluorescent saccharides from the unreacted ones using a Source
30Q column with an NaCl gradient from 0 to 0.5 M over 100 min at
a flow rate of 2 ml/min, and finally (iii) removing the NaCl through
desalting with a Sephadex G10 column and 50 mM ammonium
acetate. Samples containing the same compound were pooled
and freeze-dried after each separation step. After the last separation
step, the products were identified with MALDI-TOF.
