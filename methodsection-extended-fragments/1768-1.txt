\f0\fs24 \cf0 High-performance anion exchange chromatography\
analysis The composition of the reaction mixture (UDPFig\
sugars and heparosan oligosaccharides) was analyzed by\
high-performance anion exchange chromatography\
(HPAEC) using an ICS-3000 Ion Chromatography HPLC\
system equipped with a CarboPac PA-1 column (2??~\
250 mm), in combination with a CarboPac PA guard column\
(2??~25 mm), a VWD-3100 single wave detector (Dionex,\
Sunnyvale, USA), and a pulsed electrochemical detector in\
pulsed amperometric detection mode (Dionex, Sunnyvale,\
CA, USA) in series. The same elution conditions as previously\
described were used (Chavaroche et al. 2011). The\
presence of a peak with UV detection, as with electrochemical\
detection, shows the presence of an UDP group\
(Orellana and Mohnen 1999).}
