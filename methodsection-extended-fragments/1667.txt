After heat inactivation of the enzyme and freeze-drying the reaction
mixture, the HA products were separated using flash column
chromatography with Silica Gel 60 as column material and n-butanol/
water/acetic acid (3:1:1) as eluent [17]. The tubes containing
the same compound were pooled and dried with a rotavap. As a final
step, the purified HA oligosaccharides were identified using
HPLC and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-offlight
(MALDI-TOF). The prepared stock of HA4 still contained minor
traces of HA2.
