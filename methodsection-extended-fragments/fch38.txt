Detection of quaternary structure
Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) was used to study the
aggregation state of the proteins. SEC was carried out on a
Superdex S200 HR column (Pharmacia Biotech) with a bed
volume of 24 mL. The column was equilibrated and run with
10 mM phosphate-buffer pH 7.0 and 50 mM NaCl at 20 -C.
The sample (200 AL, 5 mg/mL in the same buffer) was applied
to the column and the flow-rate was set to 0.4 mL/min;
detection took place at 280 nm.
