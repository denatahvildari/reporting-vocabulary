To obtain fractions of lignan macromolecule with different molecular masses, aliquots of 100 ll containing 2 mg lignan macromolecule (cleaned over SPE)/ml 63% (v/v) EtOH were injected on a similar HPLC system as described for RP-HPLC, equipped with a Tricorn Superdex Peptide 10/300 GL column (Amersham Bioscience; 10  300???310 mm, bed volume = 24 ml,optimum separation range 100???7000 Da). Fractions (0.8 ml) were collected during three subsequent runs. The column was run isocratically at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min with 40% (v/v) aq. ACN + 0.1% (v/v) TFA as eluent. The eluate was monitored at 280 nm. The included volume (Vinc = 16.5 ml) was determined with water. No further calibration of the Superdex Peptide column
was performed since no suitable calibration compounds were available. The same procedure was used to determine the molecular weight distribution of the GPC-fractions isolated from the parental lignan macromolceule. The injection volume was 50 ll. 4.6. Determination molar extinction coefficients of CouAG, FeAG, HDG and SDG CouAG, FeAG, HDG and SDG were purified by preparative RPHPLC as described previously (Struijs et al., 2007). Based on stock-solutions of about 10 mg/ml, dilution series in MeOH were made. The absorbance at 280 nm of these dilutions was measured
against MeOH in a 1 ml quartz cuvet. The molar extinction coefficients (e) were calculated using Abs = e * l * c in which Abs = absorbance
at 280 nm, l = light path = 1 cm, c = concentration (M). 4.7. Determination HMGA by GC-MS Lignan macromolecule (2 mg/ml in EtOH) was fully saponified. Aliqouts (0.5 ml) were spiked with 50 lg glutaric acid (GA) dissolved in water (50 ll, 1 mg/ml) as internal standard. A calibration
curve was made with a concentration range of HMGA (Aldrich) starting from a 1 mg/ml stock-solution. The volume was increased to 5 ml with water and the pH was adjusted to pH 1.5???2.0 with HCl. The samples were evaporated to dryness under a stream of air at 50 C. To remove residual water, 100 ll acetone was added and evaporated. Reaction vials were purged with N2. To obtain TMSi derivatives, to each dried sample 1 ml of HMDS:TMCS:pyridine (3:1:9; SIL-PREP Kit, Alltech) was added. After 2 h the derivatisation reaction was complete and the derivatized samples were analyzed on a GC 8000TOP system with an AS800 auto sampler and FID-detection (Thermo Finnigan) equipped with a DB-1 column (J&W; 30  0.25  1.0). Injection volume was 1 ll (splitless injection). The temperature program was a follows: t = 0 min, 80 C; t = 0???12 min, 80???325 C (linear increase); t = 10??? 42 min, 325 C. Helium was used as a carrier gas at 100 kPa. The FID-detector was set on 350 C. GC-MS data were obtained by analyzing the derivatized samples on a Trace GC (Thermo Finnigan) coupled to a Polaris Q mass spectrophotometer. The settings of the GC were similar as describe above. MS data were collected by electron impact, in full scan mode between 5 and 25 min of the GC run, in the positive ion mode over a mass range of 50???400 Da. The temperature of the ion source was 250 C. The auto-tune function was used to optimize the MS settings.
