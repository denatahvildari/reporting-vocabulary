Detection in full scan mode (m/z.100???1000), the following mass traces were used for quantification: laurolactam m/z.198.2, dimer m/z.395.4, trimer: m/z.592.6. A Hypersil ODS5 with 1254mm i.d. and 5 mm particle size was used; 0.8 ml min1 total flow of the mobile phase, injection volume 15 ml. Quantification by external standards. Isooctane samples (0.25 ml) and standards were evaporated using a stream of nitrogen and redissolved in 0.25 ml methanol before injection. Other samples and standards were directly injected. Gradient: from 30% A (methanol) 70% B (water) for 3 min, to 90% A in 6 min, held for 6 min, returning in 1 min to 30% A for 10 min. Retention times were: laurolactam: 8.1, dimer: 8.9, trimer: 9.9. Size exclusion chromatography (SEC). Pump: Gynkotek N480, mobile phase: azeotropic mixture of ethyl acetate and cyclohexane (56:44, w/w), flow: 3ml min1, column: Pharmacia XK26/40, 26mm i.d., bed height 370 mm, filled with Bio-Beads SX-3 swollen in the eluent described above, refraction index detector: Gynkotek RI SE-51, autosampler: Gilson Abimed 231XL equipped with a syringe pump 402, fraction collector: Gilson Abimed 201. Olive oil sample clean-up. A 0.5 g oil aliquot was filled up to a total weight of 5 g using the GPC mobile phase mentioned above. A total of 4ml of this solution was injected into the SEC. The fraction containing the oil was determined by injection of a blank (10% w/w olive oil in eluent), the fraction containing laurolactam was determined by injection of a 10 000 mgml1 laurolactam standard in eluent. The olive oil peak eluted roughly at between 23 and 34 min. The following fraction was completely collected and analysed as follows: the collected fraction (approximately 75 ml) was evaporated at 60C and 350 mbar in a rotary evaporator to about 1 ml, quantitatively transferred into a 10-ml volumetric flask and dried down using a stream of nitrogen. The residue was redissolved in 10 ml methanol and a 15-ml aliquot was injected into the LC/MS system. For calibration, oil standards spiked with 0, 1, 5, 10, 25 and 50 mgg1 laurolactam, respectively, were cleaned-up along with the test samples. Oligomer concentrations were determined using response factors determined by injections of
laurolactam, dimer and trimer standards.
