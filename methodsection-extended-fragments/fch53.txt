To demonstrate differences in net charge of the methylated ovalbumin variants, cation exchange chromatography (IEC) was performed. Separation of the different proteins was carried out on a Mono S column (Amersham-Pharmacia) with a bed volume of 1 mL supported by
A?? kta Purifier (Amersham-Pharmacia). The column was equilibrated with 50 mM sodium acetate (pH 5.0) at 20 ??C. A 100-??L of a 5 mg/mL protein sample was applied to the column, and the flow rate was set to 0.5 mL/min. Proteins were eluted in 50 mM sodium acetate by applying a gradient of 1 M NaCl (pH 5.0) from to 100% over 20 column volumes. Protein detection took place at 220 nm. Modification of Carboxylates by WRK. The available number of carboxylates on the protein was determined by a modified
method, as originally described by Sinha and Brewer.7 Modification Reaction. Proteins were dissolved in 4.5 mL 50 mM MES buffer at pH 5.0 containing 1% SDS to a final concentration
of 1 mM carboxylates. After addition of 0.5 mL of WRK from a 200 mM stock solution in 0.01 N HCl, the mixture was incubated for 15 min at 22 ??C, while the pH was maintained at 5.0 ( 0.1 with 0.2 M NaOH using a pH-stat setup. Removal of Unreacted WRK. The reacted protein was isolated from unbound WRK by applying the sample to a Sephadex PD-
10 gel filtration column that was equilibrated with 50 mM MES (pH 5.0). A 2.5-mL sample was applied to the column, and subsequently, 3.5 mL of elution buffer (50 mM MES, pH 5.0) was put on top, as described by the manufacturer. The absorbance of the first fraction of 1.5 mL that was eluted from the PD-10 column was determined at 269 nm. The absorbance value was divided by the molar extinction coefficient from the calibration curve to
calculate the molar concentration of carboxylates.
