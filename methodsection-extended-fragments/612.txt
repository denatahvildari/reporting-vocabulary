The resulting fatty acid methyl esters were subjected to gas chromatography (GC; Chrompack CP-9000, Delft, The Netherlands) using a Chrompack WCOT fused silica column packed with CP-Sil 88 with the following temperature program: 100 °C (10 min) to 220 °C (5 min) at 4°/min with a carrier gas (He) flow rate of 40 ml/min. Fatty acids were identified by aid of a standard bacterial fatty acid methyl esters CP mix (Supelco, Bellefonte, PA, USA). Relative amounts of fatty esters were calculated from the peak areas of the methyl esters using a Chromatopac C-R6A integrator (Shimadsu, Kyoto, Japan).
