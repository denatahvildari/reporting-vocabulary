Liquid chromatography coupled on-line to mass spectrometry (LC-MS) The molecular mass of the lignans and fragments of the macromolecule were determined on a Thermo Finnigan LCQ Classic coupled on-line to the analytical RP-HPLC. The flow from the analytical RP-HPLC was split: 1/10th was directed to the MS. The MS was equipped with an ESI injector. Spectra were obtained in the negative ion mode over an m /z  range of 150???2000 Da. The capillary temperature was 270  C, the capillary voltage was 7.00 V, the ion spray voltage was set on 4.50 kV and helium was used as sheath gas. MS/MS analysis was performed with a normalized collision energy of 27%.
