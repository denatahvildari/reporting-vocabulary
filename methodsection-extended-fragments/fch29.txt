The pectin samples were produced by
Degussa Texturant Systems, Redon, France. Three citrus
pectin samples, A, B, and C, with about the same DM but
differing in their degree of blockiness (DB) were investigated,
see Table 1.20 Pectins A and B originate from the same lemon
variety. The MW of the samples, determined with highperformance
size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC), were
 82 kDa for pectins A and C and 78 kDa for pectin B.
 B. Uronic Acid Content. Pectins (60 ??g/mL) were boiled
(1 h), cooled, and then saponified with sodium hydroxide
(40 mM). The uronide content was determined by the
automated colorimetric m-hydroxydiphenyl method.21-23
 C. Degree of Blockiness. The pectins were digested with
polygalacturonase of KluiVeromyces fragilis (PGkf) which
needs 4 or more free GalA to act. Degradation products were
analyzed by HPAEC at pH 5.20,24 Quantification of these
oligomers is possible by integration from HPAEC pH 5
elution profiles. From these results, the degree of blockiness
was determined25,26 (Table 1).
