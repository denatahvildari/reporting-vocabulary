Monomeric sugars were measured by HPAEC-PAD (High Performance
Anion Exchange Chromatography with Pulsed Amperometric
Detection). A Dionex system with Carbopak PA1 column with
pre-column was used at 30 ???C, with de-ionised water as mobile
phase (1 mL/min) and fucose as internal standard. The Dionex HPLC
method was also used for determination of monomeric sugars in the aqueous phase of the acid treated NEDO-JPC. Dry matter content
was 19.9% (w/w) (24 h at 105 ???C). The chemical composition of
the used NEDO-JPC is shown in Table 1.
