Concentrations of DCA were determined by analyzing 100-??l
headspace samples on a Chrompack CP9000 gas chromatograph,
equipped with a CP-Sil 8CB column (Chrompack, Middelburg, The
Netherlands). The oven temperature was 100 ??C and the vials were
kept at 30 ??C. Chloride concentrations were determined using a
colorimetric assay (Bergmann and Sanik 1957)
