Volatile compounds were identified using
purge-and-trap thermal desorption cold-trap (TDCT)
gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS).
Cheese paste was mixed with double distilled water
(1:3 wt:vol) and homogenised and subsequently 20mL
of this mixture was purged with 150mLmin1  helium
gas for 30 min at room temperature. The volatile
compounds were trapped on an absorbent trap containing
carbotrap (80 mg, 20???40 mesh, Supelco, Belle Fonte,
PA, USA) and carbosieve SIII (10 mg, 60???80 mesh,
Supelco). The trapped compounds were transferred onto
a capillary column of a gas chromatograph using a
ChrompackPTI injector (Chrompack, Middelburg, The
Netherlands) in the TCDT mode, by heating the trap for
10 min at 250 C. A narrow injection band was achieved
by cryofocusing at  100 C. The conditions for the
chromatographic separation and mass spectrometry
were as described previously (Engels, 1997 ). Structures
were assigned by spectrum interpretation, comparison
of the spectra with bibliographic data and comparison
with retention times of reference compounds.
Quantification of components was performed using a
gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionisation
detector (GC-FID) (FID 40, Carlo Erba, Milan, Italy)
as described by Ayad, Verheul, Wouters, and Smit
(2000) . Sulphur compounds were analysed in duplicate
by head space GC analysis using an FPD detector
(Carbo Erba, Milan, Italy) as described by de Jong,
Neeter, Boelrijk, and Smit (2000) . For quantification the
average peakareas and the deviations were determined.
