The acid soluble lignin in the hydrolyzate was determined by spectrophotometric determination at 205 nm.Monomeric sugars were measured by HPAEC-PAD
(High Performance Anion Exchange Chromatography with Pulsed Amperometric Detection). A Dionex syste mwith Carbopak PA1 column with pre-column was used at 30 ???C, with deionized water as mobile phase (1 mL/min) and fucose as internal standard. For comparison purposes, the Dionex HPLC method was also used for determination of monomeric arabinose in the liquid phase of both pretreated and enzymatically hydrolyzed wheat straw. Dry matter content was 91.8% (w/w) (24 h at 105 ???C). On dry matter base, the straw composition was: 36.3% cellulose, 23.2% hemicellulose, 25.5% lignin, 3.3% protein, 7.8% extractives, and 6.7% ash (w/w). The arabinan content was 2.1% (w/w).
