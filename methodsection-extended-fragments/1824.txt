Analytical procedures Samples were taken from the influent and effluent flow dur-ing operation and filtered through a 0.45  m filter (Millex-LCR,Merck Millipore, USA). NH4+-N was analyzed using a colorimetric cuvette test (LCK303, Hach Lange, Germany). Acetate, NO3???-Nand PO43???-P were analyzed with ion chromatography (Com-pact IC 761 equipped with a conductivity detector, Metrohm,Switzerland). For the acetate measurement the ion chromatographwas equipped with the pre-column Metrosep Organic Acids Guard(Metrohm, Switzerland) and a column Synergi 4u hydro-RP 80A(Phenomenex, USA). For the NO3???-N and PO43???-P measurements the ion chromatograph was equipped with the pre-column Met-rosep A Supp 4/5 Guard and the column Metrosep A Supp 5,150/4.0 mm (Metrohm, Switzerland).
