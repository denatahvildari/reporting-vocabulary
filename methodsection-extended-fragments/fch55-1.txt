\f0\fs24 \cf0 The released sugars were analyzed using high\
performance anion exchange chromatography (HPAEC)\
with pulsed amperometric detection (PAD) using a Dionex\
system containing a ThermoQuest HPLC system and a\
Dionex EDM Helium degas unit. After hydrolysis the\
samples were injected on a Carbopac PA10 column\
(4250 mm) with a Carbopac PA10 guard column (4\
50 mm) preceded with a borate trap (Dionex) and separated at\
1 mL/min by isocratic elution with water for 40 min followed\
by a linear gradient from 0 to 800 mM NaOH in 30 min.\
Detection was performed after the post column addition\
of 0.5mL/min of 1M NaOH using a Dionex ED 40 PAD\
detector.\
