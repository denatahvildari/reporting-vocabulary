Reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) was used according to a method adapted from a previously described procedure29 to determine how much of the protein was hydrolyzed into peptides. All samples were analyzed in aqueous solutions containing 4 M urea and 0.3% DTT. RP-HPLC was carried out using 2 M 6000A pumps in combination with a highsensitivity accessory block (Waters), an ISS-100 injector (Perkin- Elmer, Uberlingen, Germany), a Waters model 680 gradient controller, and a Kratros 783 detector (Kratos Analytical, Ramsey, NJ, USA). A 250 ??~ 4.6 mm Aeris wide-pore C18 column (Phenomex, The Netherlands) was used with a KrudKatcher Ultra HPLC column inline filter (Phenomex) as a guard column. A 10 ??L pea protein sample was injected onto a wide-pore C18 analytical column thermostated at 40 ??C. Samples were eluted at a flow rate of 0.40 mL/min with a linear gradient of 0.10 v/v % trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in 98 v/v % water and 2 v/v % acetonitrile to 0.10 v/v % TFA in 10 v/v % water and 90 v/v % acetonitrile. The equipment was linked to a data acquisition and processing system (Turbochrom, Perkin-Elmer). Data analysis was done with Chromeleon software version 7.1 (ThermoFisher Scientific).
