HPSEC
High performance size exclusion chromatography was performed
on a ThermoQuest HPLC using a series of three TosoHaas
TSK-Gel G columns (4000PWXL, 3000PWXL, 2500PWXL). Samples
(100 lL; 5 mg/mL) were separated at 30 C using a 50 mM ammonium
formiate buffer (pH 5.1) at 0.8 mL/min as eluent. Separation
was monitored using a refractive index (RI) detector, and 0.5 mL
fractions were collected in 96-well plates. The fractions were subsequently pooled for sugar composition analysis or further analyzed
using MAb assays.
