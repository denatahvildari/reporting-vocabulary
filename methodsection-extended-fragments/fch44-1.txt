\f0\fs24 \cf0 Porous-graphitized-carbon liquid chromatography with\
evaporative light scattering and mass spectrometric detection\
PGC-HPLC-ELSD/MS was performed on a Thermo Accela UHPLC\
system (Waltham, MA, USA) equipped with a Hypercarb column\
(PGC, 100  2.1 mm, 3 lm) in combination with a Hypercarb guard\
column (10  2.1 mm; 3 lm, Thermo Electron Corporation). Elution\
was performed with a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min and a column\
oven temperature of 70 C. The injection volume was set to 10 lL\
(0.1???0.4 mg/mL for purified AOS and 5 mg/mL for sugar beet arabinan\
digest D30/100). The following eluents were used: Millipore\
water (A), acetonitrile (B), and 0.2% (w/v) trifluoroacetic acid\
(TFA) in water (C). To all the eluents 25 lM lithium acetate was\
added to ensure lithium adduct formation of all components during\
the MS analysis. The following elution profile was used: 0???\
1 min, isocratic 100% A, 1???15 min, linear gradient from 0% to\
27.5% (v/v) B, 15???28 min linear gradient from 27.5% to 60% B,\
and concomitant linear gradient from 0% to 10% (v/v) C, 28???\
31 min linear gradient from 60% to 80% B, and from 10% to 20%\
C, 31???35 min isocratic 80% B and 20% C, 35???36 min from 80% B\
and 20% C to 100% A, 36???41 min equilibration with 100% A. The\
PGC-column was coupled to a 1:1-splitter (Accurate, Dionex Corporation)\
directing the eluent both to an ELSD 85 evaporative light\
scattering detector (Sedere, Alfortville, France) and an ESI-MSndetector\
(LTQ XL MS, ion trap, Thermo Electron Corporation). The\
drift tube temperature of the ELSD was set to 50 C and the gain\
to 12. MS-detection was performed in positive mode using a spray\
voltage of 4.6 kV and a capillary temperature of 260 C and auto tuned on arabino-tetraose (m/z 553). The ion trap was closed either\
after 10 ms or when an intensity of 3  105 was reached to enable\
the detection of minor components and to avoid the overload of\
the MS by abundant components. The MSn-experiments were performed\
using wide band activation and based on dependent scansettings\
(Xcalibur software, Thermo Electron Corporation).\
For modeling of the 3D-structure of the linear and branched\
AOS the software ChemBio Office 2010 (CambridgeSoft Corporation,\
Cambridge, MA, USA) was used.\
