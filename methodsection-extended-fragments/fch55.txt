Molecular Weight Distribution and Fractionation
by High Performance Size Exclusion Chromatography (HPSEC) The EPS (2 mg) was dissolved in 1 mL of distilled water and analyzed by HPSEC performed on a ThermoQuest HPLC
using three TosoHaas TSK-Gel columns in series (4000-,
3000-, 2500-, PWXL) preceded by an TSK guard column
(406 mm). The sample (20 mL) was injected and eluted at
308C using 0.8 mL/min 0.2M NaNO3. Detection was
performed using a Shodex RI 71 refractive index detector.
For fractionation 100 mL sample of 6 mg/mL was injected
on the same system and eluted the same way. Fractions of
240 mL were collected in 96-well plates using a Gilson
FC203B fraction collector. The fractions were pooled according
to the carbohydrate populations different in molecular
weight and freeze-dried before subjecting them to sugar
composition analysis.
