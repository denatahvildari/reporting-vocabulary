\f0\fs24 \cf0 Anion-exchange chromatography was performed on a DEAE Sepharose\
Fast Flow column (50  2.6 cm, Amersham Bioscience,\
Sweden) using an akta explorer system (Amersham Biosciences,\
Sweden). The sample (280 ml; 0.5 mg/mL) was loaded to the column\
(10 mL/min). After loading with sample, the column was\
washed with water for 1 column volume (250 mL, 50 mL/min)\
and eluted successively with a linear gradient of 0???2 M of NaOAc\
buffer, pH 5, within 10 column volumes. Finally the column was\
washed with 2 column volumes of 1 M NaOH. During elution with\
NaOAc buffer, fractions of 50 mL were collected as well as the column\
washed and analysed for neutral sugar and uronic acid content\
as described. The alkaline fractions were neutralised directly\
by adding acetic acid. After pooling appropriate fractions, pools\
were dialysed and freeze-dried. 3.4.12. 13C and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)\
Prior to NMR analyses, the sample was dissolved in 5 mM\
NaOAc, pH 5, to set the pD = pH and freeze-dried. Then the sample\
was dissolved in 99.96% D2O (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories,\
USA) and after freeze-drying dissolved again in 99.996%\
D2O (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, USA). NMR spectra were\
recorded at a probe temperature of 25 C on a Bruker AV-600\
spectrometer equipped with a cryoprobe located at Biqualys,\
Wageningen. Chemical shifts were expressed in ppm relative to\
internal acetone: d = 2.225 ppm for 1H. The 1D 1H proton spectra\
were recorded at 600.13 MHz using 64 scans of 8192 data points\
and a sweep width of 3000 Hz.}
