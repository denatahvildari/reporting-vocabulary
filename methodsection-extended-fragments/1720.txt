Samples were taken from the influent and effluent flow during operation. After filtering through a 0.45 mm filter, samples were analyzed for NO 3 -N and PO3 4 -P with ion chromatography (Metrohm Compact IC 761 equipped with a conductivity detector, using the pre-column Metrohm Metrosep A Supp 4/5 Guard and the column Metrohm Metrosep A Supp 5, 150/ 4.0 mm). Gas samples were analyzed with gas chromatography to determine the amount of oxygen gas formed in addition to the dissolved oxygen (Varian, CP-4900 equipped  with a thermal conductivity detector using a Mol Sieve 5 A?? PLOT 10 m column at 80 C and a PoraPlot U 10 m column at 65 C, and argon as carrier gas at 1.47 mL/min).
