This was checked using gel-permeation chromatography on a Superdex-75 column ran in 10mM Hepes buffer (pH 7.2), containing 50mM NaCl to prevent nonspecific interactions with the column material. Under these conditions all b -Lg variants proteins eluted as single symmetric peaks representing the dimer form of the  protein with an apparent mass of 36 kDa based on elution profiles of calibration proteins (results not
shown).
