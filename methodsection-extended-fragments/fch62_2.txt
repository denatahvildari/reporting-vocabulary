Lignans and fragments of the lignan macromolecule were purified by preparative RP-HPLC on an X-Terra C18 MS column (Waters; 5 lm particle size, 50 ?? 100 mm, OBD) with an X-Terra C18 MS guard column (Waters; 5 lm particle size, 19 ?? 10 mm) ran on aWaters preparative HPLC system equipped with a 2525 pump, 2767 sample manager, Fluid Organizer and 2996 photodiode array detector. Water and ACN, both acidified with 0.01% TFA, were used as eluents. The flow rate was 80 ml/min. The linear gradient was as follows: 0???16.6 min, 10???30% ACN; 16.6???20 min, 30???50% ACN; 20???26.6 min, isocratic on 50% ACN; 26.6???28 min, 50???100% ACN; 28???31.3 min, isocratic on 100% ACN; 31.3???33.3 min, 100???10% ACN; 33.3???40 min, isocratic on 10% ACN. Up to 600 mg of lignans (2 mg partially or fully saponified lignan macromolecule/ml water) were loaded per run.  Prior to loading, the sample was filtered over a 0.2 l m cellulose acetate filter (Schleicher & Schuell) to remove residual insoluble particles. Sample was loaded using the Waters reagent manager with a maximum flow rate of 2 ml/min. Based on the response at 280 nm, fractions were collected (leading edge gradient = 5%, peak terminates when valley = 0). Appropriate fractions were pooled, as were the corresponding pools from subsequent runs. ACN was evaporated and the fractions were lyophilized. The purity of the fractions pooled was determined on analytical HPLC.
