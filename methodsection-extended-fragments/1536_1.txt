The preparation of protein for Nterminal
sequencing was completed before the optimized
purification strategy described above was developed and
involved Q-Sepharose chromatography, dialysis into
1M .NH4.2SO4, centrifugation, chromatography on
butyl???Sepharose, dialysis into 2 M .NH4.2SO4 + standard
Hepes buffer, chromatography on a 1 ml Resource
Ether linkage column from Pharmacia, and preparative
2% agarose gel electrophoresis.
