Liquid chromatography???mass spectrometry
Tenmicrolitres of sample were applied to a Vydac C18
reversed-phase column (300A?? ; 5 ??m; 0.46 ???? 25 cm;
Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) on a Spectra System
high-performance liquid chromatograph (Thermo
Separation Products, Inc., San Jose, CA, USA)
coupled to an LCQ mass spectrometer (Finnigan
MAT, San Jose, CA, USA). The solvents used were
water containing trifluoroacetic acid (1.5mL L???1)
(solvent A) and acetonitrile containing trifluoroacetic
acid (1.5mL L???1) (solvent B). The following gradient
was applied: 0% B for 5min, linear to 25% B between
5 and 45 min, linear to 50% B between 45 and
68 min, linear to 100% B between 68 and 77min,
100% B between 77 min and 82 min, followed by
reconditioning of the column at 0% B for 27 min. A
flow rate of 0.2mL min???1 was used. The absorbance
of the eluate was monitored at 700 nm. The mass
spectrum was collected using the positive electrospray
ionization (ESI) mode with a capillary heated at
200 ???C, a source voltage of 4.5 kV, and a sheath
gas flow of 60 arbitrary units with helium as the
spraying gas. Full-scan spectra were acquired from
100 to 2000 m/z. The tune method was made with
a glycine tripeptide. MS-MS fragmentation patterns
were also recorded. Data were processed using
Xcalibur??? software (Finnigan MAT).
