Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) was performed on a ??KTA micro liquid chromatography system equipped with a Superose 6 column (both GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden). The samples (50 mL, w10 mg/mL protein) were eluted with 50 mM Tris/HCl buffer (pH 8) containing 150 mM NaCl at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min at room temperature. Elution was monitored by UV detection at 280 nm (internal detector) and by refractive index detection (Shodex RI150, Showa Denko K.K., Tokyo, Japan). Apparent molecular weights were estimated using a high molecular weight gel filtration calibration kit (GE Healthcare).
