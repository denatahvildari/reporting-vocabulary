Monomeric sugars were measured by HPAEC-PAD (High Performance Anion Exchange Chromatography with Pulsed Amperometric Detection). A Dionex system with Carbopak PA1 column with pre-column was used at 30 ???C, with de-ionized water as mobile
phase (1 mL/min) and fucose as internal standard. The Dionex HPLC
method was also used for determination of monomeric sugars in the
aqueous phase of both pretreated and enzymatically hydrolyzed
wheat straw. Dry matter content was 91.8% (w/w) (24 h at 105 ???C).
The chemical composition of the used wheat straw is shown in
Table 1.
