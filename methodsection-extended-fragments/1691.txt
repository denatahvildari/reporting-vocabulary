Fatty acid composition was analyzed to quantify LPS and PL content, using a modified gas chromatography method [51,52]. LPS was isolated by hot phenol???water extraction as described before [53] and quantified using the peak height of C14:0???3OH with C12:0???2OH as the internal standard (two C14:0???3OH residues per LPS), while PL was quantified using the peak heights sum of C16:0, C16:1, C18:0 and C18:1 with C15:0 as the internal standard. Specific protein yields (g total protein and g trivalent PorA per 1010 bacteria) were used to estimate OMV yield. Optical density was measured to calculate the number of harvested bacteria (1 OD unit at 590nm corresponds to 4.4????109 cfu/mL).
