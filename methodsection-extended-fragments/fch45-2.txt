\f0\fs24 \cf0 Reversed-phase HPLC??? NMR\
Reversed-phase HPLC???NMR was performed on a\
HPLC system (Bruker) equipped with a Thermohypersil\
Aquasil C18 column (4.6 mm ID??~150 mm; 3 m)\
in combination with a Thermohypersil (Keystone Scientific)\
Aquasil C18 guard column (4.6 mm ID??~10 mm;\
3 m). Furthermore, the HPLC system was connected\
to a Bruker peak sampling unit (BPSU; Bruker) following\
UV detection (205???215 nm; Bruker). Elution (0.8\
mL/min) was performed using a gradient of degassed\
(Membrane degasser; Bruker) methanol in D2O: 0???16\
v/v% methanol in 0???40 min. Samples containing\
mainly X4Ac (10 mg/mL) or X3Ac (15 mg/mL),  obtained by size-exclusion chromatography, were applied to RP-HPLC??? NMR (100  L/ run). Each elution\
was followed by a equilibration step (isocratic D2 O; 30\
min). Samples were transported one by one from the\
BPSU to the NMR probe, using the same ratio of\
D2 O/ methanol as was necessary for the particular\
oligomers to elute from the RP-column.\
NMR spectra were recorded at a probe temperature\
of 25 ?? C on a Bruker DPX-400 spectrometer located at\
the Wageningen NMR Centre. Solvent signals were\
suppressed with double presaturation using Bruker\
LC??? NMR software. 1 H chemical shifts are expressed in\
ppm relative to methanol (  3.34). 1D 1 H NMR spectra\
were recorded at 400 MHz using up to 2000 scans of\
32,768 data points and a sweep width of 8000 Hz. The\
2D TOCSY spectrum was acquired using a standard\
Bruker pulse sequence. 496 experiments of 2048 data\
points were recorded using 240 scans per increment\
resulting in a measuring time of 66 h. The mixing time\
was 65 ms.}
