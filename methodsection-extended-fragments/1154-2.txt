For determining the relation between the size and molar mass
of the species present in the final cross-linked reaction product, the
latter was separated into chromatographic fractions on a Sephacryl S-500HR (GE Healthcare) column (exclusion limit is between 4  104 and 2  107 kDa for Dextran standards), connected to an AKTA purifier system (GE Healthcare). A volume of 100 mL of final
reaction product was injected onto the column, and eluted with
0.1MNH4Ac (pH 6.8), at room temperature, at a flowrate of 0.8 mL/
min. Prior to injection, the column was equilibrated with elution
buffer. Detection was done using at 280 nm and 318 nm. Fractions
of 0.5 mL were collected for elution volumes from 8 mL to 18 mL.
For the light scattering analysis, the fractions were concentrated
about 10 times using Amicon Ultra centrifugal filters (Cat No.
UFC8000396). The protein concentration of the concentrated
fractions was determined spectroscopically at 280 nm (see sample
preparation). Static and dynamic light scattering experiments were
done on each of the concentrated fractions using a Malvern
Nanosizer ZS (Malvern) equipped with an Argon ion laser emitting
vertically polarized light with a wavelength of 633 nm. The scattering
angle was 12.8. Hydrodynamic radii RH reported are the major peak from the peak analysis as performed by the Malvern DTS software, version 6.20. Weight-averaged molar masses Mw were determined from the static light scattering intensities using the Rayleigh expression
KRC Rq . 1 Mw (1) where C is the weight concentration.
