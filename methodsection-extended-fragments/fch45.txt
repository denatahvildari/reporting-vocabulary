Size-exclusion chromatography
To fractionate the AcXOS-mixture (163 mg in 2 mL) a
Pharmacia system equipped with a BioGel P-2 column
(900??~26 mm; 200???400 mesh, Bio-Rad Laboratories)
thermostated at 60 ??C was used. Elution was performed
at 0.5 mL/min with water (60 ??C) and fractions were
collected every 2 mL. The eluent was detected by a
Shodex RI-72 detector. Four of these size-exclusion
runs were performed to obtain sufficient material of
pool X4Ac.
