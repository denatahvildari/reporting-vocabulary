High-performance size exclusion chromatography
analysis The size distribution and the molecular weight of
the heparosan polymers were analyzed by HPSEC on an
Ultimate 3000 (Dionex, Sunnyvale, USA) using three
TosoH Bioscience TSK-gel columns in series (4000, 3000,
and 2500 Super AW, 150??~6.0 mm) preceded by a TSK AWL
guard column (35??~4.6 mm; TosoH Bioscience, Japan) as
previously described (Chavaroche et al. 2011). For each
HPSEC analysis, the molecular weight and the size distribution
of the samples were determined by fitting to a logarithmic
model the elution time of the hyaluronan molecular
mass markers (30, 160, and 262 kDa, Hyalose) (Chavaroche
et al. 2010).
