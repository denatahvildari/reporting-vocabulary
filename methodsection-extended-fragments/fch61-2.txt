\f0\fs24 \cf0 For kinetic experiments, ??-D-Galp-(1,4)-D-Galp [hereafter\
referred to as Gal(??1???4)Gal] concentration was\
varied in the range of 0.05???8.0 mg/ml and measured by\
high-performance anion-exchange chromatography\
(HPAEC). The reactions were carried out in 2 mM\
potassium phosphate buffer pH 6.0 and 0.12 U/ml ??-\
galactosidase for 60 min at 37??C. The incubations were\
stopped by heating the incubation mixtures for 5 min at\
100??C. After centrifugation (5 min, 10,000 g) the supernatant\
was analysed by HPAEC using a Dionex system\
equipped with a Dionex CarboPac PA-1 (4 mm ID ??~ 250\
mm) column in combination with a CarboPac PA guard\
column (3 mm ID ??~25 mm) and a pulsed electrochemical\
detector in pulsed amperometric detection (PAD) mode\
(Dionex, Sunnyvale, Calif.). A flow rate of 1 ml/min was\
used with the following gradient of sodium acetate in 0.1\
M NaOH: 0???15 min, 0???100 mM; 15???20 min, 100???200\
mM; 20???21 min, 200???1,000 mM. Each elution was\
followed by a washing step of 5 min in 1,000 mM sodium\
acetate and an equilibration step of 15 min 0.1 M NaOH.\
The hydrolytic activity of ??-Gal II towards different\
types of oligosaccharides was measured by HPAEC, using\
the same gradient as for the kinetic experiments. The\
incubations were performed with 1 mg/ml substrate under\
the conditions described above.}
