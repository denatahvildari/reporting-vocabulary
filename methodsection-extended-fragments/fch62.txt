4.2. Saponification of the lignan macromolecule
Solutions of 2 mg/ml lignan macromolecule in 63% (v/v)
aq. EtOH containing various concentrations NaOH were
(partially) saponified to obtain lignan macromolecular
fragments of various sizes. NaOH concentrations ranging
from 1 to 25 mM NaOH were used for partial saponification.
For full saponification 75 mM NaOH was used.
Saponification was performed at room temperature while
stirring. After 24 h, the reaction was stopped by lowering
the pH to 6.5???7.0 with HOAc (20 mM???1.5 M for analytical
purposes, glacial HOAc for preparative purification purposes).
For analytical purposes, the incubation volume
was 1 ml, for preparative purification purposes a volume
of 2.5 l was used.
 Resolubilisation of the insoluble material in 63% (v/v) aq. EtOH and
analysis of this material on analytical RP-HPLC did not
show any peaks corresponding to peaks annotated as constituents
of the lignan macromolecule (Fig. 3).
After activation of the SepPak cartridge with successively
2 column volumes of MeOH and 2 column volumes
of water, a maximum of 150 mg (partially) saponified lignan
macromolecule (supernatant) was loaded onto the cartridge.
After a wash step with 1 column volume of water,
lignans were eluted from the cartridge with 3 column volumes
of MeOH of which the first column volume was discarded.
For analytical purposes, the MeOH was
evaporated under a stream of air to a final volume of
1 ml. For purification purposes, all MeOH was evaporated
and the (partially) saponified lignans were lyophilized. Aliquots
of the samples were analyzed on analytical RPHPLC.
After full and partial saponification (2 mM NaOH)
of 5.0 g lyophilized lignan macromolecule and sample clean
up, 2.5 g and 2.8 g of fully and partially saponified lignan
macromolecule was obtained, respectively.
4.4. Analytical reversed phase HPLC (RP-HPLC)
Samples were analyzed on an X-Terra C18 MS column
(Waters; 3.5 lm particle size, 4.6 ?? 150 mm) with an XTerra
C18 MS guard column (Waters; 3.5 lm particle size,
4.6 ?? 10 mm) run on a Thermo Separation Products HPLC
system equipped with a membrane degasser, P4000 pump,
AS3000 autosampler, and UV3000 detector. Water and
acetonitrile (ACN), both acidified with 0.1% (v/v) HOAc,
were used as eluents. The flow rate was 0.7 ml/min. The following
linear gradient was used: 0???25 min, 10???30% ACN;
25???30 min, 30???50% ACN; 30???40 min, isocratic on 50%
ACN; 40???42 min, 50???100% ACN; 42???47 min, isocratic on
100% ACN; 47???50 min, 100???10% ACN; 50???60 min, isocratic
on 10% ACN. The eluate was monitored at
280 nm. The injection volume was 20 ll. Samples were
injected being solved in the solvent in which they were
extracted or eluted (water, MeOH, 63% (v/v) aq. EtOH
or ACN:water mixtures).
