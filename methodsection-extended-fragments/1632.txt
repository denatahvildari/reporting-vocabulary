Analytical methods
For the analysis of monomeric sugars, the fermentation
broth samples were centrifuged (3 min at 17,400??~g), and
the pH of the supernatant was adjusted to 5.0 with barium
carbonate using a pH indicator (Bromophenolblue) followed
by filtration of the liquid. The analysis was
performed by high-performance anion-exchange chromatography
using a Carbopack PA1 column (column temperature
of 30??C) and a pulsed amperometric detector (ED50;
Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Before injection, the
system was equilibrated with 25.5 mM NaOH for 10 min
at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. For the separation of
monomeric sugars, at injection, the mobile phase was
shifted to deionized water for 30 min. Postcolumn addition
of sodium hydroxide was used for detection of the neutral
monomeric sugars.
