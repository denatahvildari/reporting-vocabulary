High performance liquid chromatography was performed with a Shimadzu Class 10A equipped with a diode array detector (Shimadzu SPD-M10A) and a 100 ml loop. Injection volume was 50 ml. The column used was a Hypersil ODS5 with 1254mm inner diameter and 5 mm particle size. The column was thermostated at 40C. Total flow was 1 ml/min. The eluents were water (A) and methanol (B). The gradient went from 30% to 90% solvent B in 8 minutes where it was held for 10 minutes. The concentration of methanol was reduced back to 30% in 0.1 minutes and held for 6.9 minutes to equilibrate. The retention times of the analytes were: laurolactam 9.4, dimer 10.8, trimer 12.2, and tetramer 12.9 minutes. The detection wavelength used was set at 207 nm. During preparative HPLC for purification of dimer and trimer standards, a Shimazu fraction collector (FRC-10A) was used. 50 ml of a solution
containing approximately 1% (w/v) of total residue as described in the reagents section were injected and fractions belonging to the peaks were collected. Yield for the tetramer was not sufficient to obtain standards that could be used for calibration purposes. High
performance liquid chromatography with mass spectrometric detection (HPLC-MS) was carried out using a Thermo Finnigan LCQ Deca (ion trap) applying atmospheric pressure chemical ionisation (APCI, Vaporizer Temperature: 450C, Corona current: 5.0 mA, heated capillary: 225C). Detection was performed in full scan mode (m/z??100???1200), using the following mass traces for quantification: laurolactam m/z??198.2, dimer m/z??395.4, trimer: m/z??592.6. Quantification was achieved by external calibration using standard solutions of the analytes. Isooctane samples and standards (0.5 ml) were evaporated using a stream of nitrogen and redissolved in 0.5 ml of methanol prior to injection. Other
samples and standards were directly injected. The column used was the same as reported in the HPLCUV section, the gradient conditions were similar to those described above for HPLC-UV. Total flow was 0.8 ml/min, injection volume was 15 ml. The methanol
concentration was held at 30% for 3 minutes, then increased to 90% in 6 minutes where it was held for 6 minutes before returning to 30% for 10 minutes. The respective retention times: laurolactam: 8.1, dimer: 8.9, trimer: 9.9 and tetramer: 10.8 minutes.
