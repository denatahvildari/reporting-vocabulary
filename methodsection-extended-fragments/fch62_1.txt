4.8. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC)
To determine the molecular weight distribution of the
lignan macromolecule and the saponified lignans, aliquots
of 50 l l (2 mg/ml) were analyzed on a similar HPLC system
as described for analytical RP-HPLC, equipped with
a Tricorn Superdex Peptide 10/300 GL column (Amersham
Bioscience; 10 ??  300???310 mm, bed volume = 24 ml, optimum
separation range 100???7000 Da). The column was
run isocratically at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min with 40% (v/
v) aq. ACN + 0.1% (v/v) TFA as eluent. The eluate was
monitored at 280 nm. The included volume (Vinc  =
16.5 ml) was determined with water. It should be noted
that part of the compounds eluted later than the included
volume indicating that aspecific interactions occurred. No
further calibration was performed since no suitable calibration
compounds were available.
