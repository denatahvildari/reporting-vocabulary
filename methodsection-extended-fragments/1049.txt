HP-SEC experiments were conducted using an AKTA purifier system (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) operated by Unicorn software. Three samples (t hydrolysis???=???2, 11, and 24 h) were freeze???dried, and ~2 mg of the freeze-dried sample was dissolved in 0.5 ml of a 0.15-M Tris???HCl buffer (pH 8) containing 8 M guanidine chloride and 0.1 M 1,4-dithiothreitol (DTT). After mixing for 4560 min, 0.215 ml of acetonitrile, containing 2% (v/v) tri-fluoroacetic acid (TFA) was added, followed by further mixing for 4560 min. After mixing, the samples were centrifuged (18,000g, 10 min, 20 ??C). Samples of 20 ??l were applied onto the column (Shodex Protein KW-803, 3008 mm, Showa Denko K. K., Tokyo, Japan). The column was equilibrated and run with 6 M urea, containing 30% (v/v) acetonitrile and 0.1% (v/v) TFA. The flow rate was 0.2 ml/min, and the absorbance was monitored at 214 nm. The column was calibrated using various proteins with molecular masses between 300 and 67,000 Da.
