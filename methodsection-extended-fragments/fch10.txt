The setup for on-line assessment of radical-scavenging activity consisted
of a Waters 600 E HPLC eluent pump (Millipore, Waters Chromatography, Milford, Mass.), a Model 231 auto sampling injector (Gilson, Middleton, Wis.), and a Waters 994 photodiode
array detector. The linear binary gradient was used at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. Solvent A was a 2% MeCN solution in water, and solvent B was 100% MeCN. Gradient conditions for the WW fraction were as follows: 0 to 10 min B=0%, from 10 to 16 min B reached 10% and was kept constant till 40 min, from 40 to 50 min B reached 100%. The compounds were separated on an Alltima C18 analytical column, 5 mm, 2504.6 mm i.d. (Alltech Associates, Deerfield, Ill.). After the separation and detection, a 45 ml laboratory-made syringe pump (Free University, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) was used for delivery of free radical solution at a flow rate of ca. 0.3 ml/min to a 15 m length PEEK tubing reaction coil. The decrease in absorbance, at 516 nm for DPPH?? and at 734 nm for ABTS??+, was measured with a 759A UV-vis detector (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif.), equipped with a tungsten lamp and connected to a recorder BD 40 (Kipp & Zonen, Delft, The Netherlands).
Readings were recorded at 0 min and then every 10 min up to 60 min. Absorbance values were corrected by subtracting 0 min readings from subsequent readings. For each concentration a blank sample (devoid of hydrogen peroxide) was used for background subtraction. Each experiment was carried out in triplicate. RA (16.67 ppm) was used as a
reference compound. The calibration curve was drawn in order to determine the hydrogen peroxide concentration in reaction media. b-Carotene bleaching test. The b-Carotene bleaching (b-CB) test was performed according to Koleva et al. [16].
