\f0\fs24 \cf0 4.6. Semi-preparative reversed phase HPLC\
 For purification of 100 mg or less lignan macromolecule\
constituents, the samples were separated on a semi-preparative\
X-Terra C18 MS column (Waters; 5 l m particle\
size, 29 ??  150 mm, OBD) with an X-Terra C18 MS guard\
column (Waters; 5 l m particle size, 19 ??  10 mm) ran on a\
Waters preparative HPLC system as specified above. The\
gradient was similar to the gradient of analytical RPHPLC.\
The flow rate was 12 ml/min. Fractions were collected\
based on the response at 280 nm as described for\
preparative RP-HPLC. The purity of the fractions was\
determined using analytical RP-HPLC and the purified\
components were lyophilized after evaporation of ACN.}
