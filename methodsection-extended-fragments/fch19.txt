The yield of the esterification reaction was 70% and the
purity of the obtained activated capric acid was over 95%.
The purity and identity of the activated capric acid was
confirmed (>97% purity) using thin-layer chromatography
(TLC), mass spectrometry, and NMR (results not shown).
Activated capric acid was covalently coupled to ovalbumin
by reaction with its free amino groups, essentially as described
by Liu et al. (2000). Therefore, ovalbumin was dissolved
at a concentration of 8.5 mg/ml in 250 ml 100 mM
sodium carbonate buffer of pH 8.5. Activated capric acid
was dissolved at a concentration of 1.4 mg/ml in 40 ml
DMSO and subsequently added to the ovalbumin solution.
This gave end concentrations of 0.2 mM ovalbumin and
0.7 mM activated capric acid.
