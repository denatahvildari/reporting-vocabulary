\f0\fs24 \cf0 Gel permeation chromatography\
The pool containing enzyme activity after MonoQ separation\
was applied to a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200\
Prepgrade (Amersham Biosciences) gel filtration column\
and eluted at 1 mL/min using 100 mM Tris/HCl buffer\
pH 7.0 and fractions (2 mL) were collected.\
 2.5. pH optimum and temperature optimum\
The pH optimum was determined in McIlvaine buffers\
in the pH range from 3 to 8. The colanic acid solutions\
(1 mL; 0.5 mg/mL) were incubated with 20 lL of enzyme\
solution (pooled after Superdex 200 separation;\
23 lg protein/mL) at 30 C for 5 h. The temperature\
optimum was measured using 0.5 mg/mL colanic acid\
in 50 mM phosphate buffer pH 7 in the range from 20\
to 80 C. The colanic acid solutions (1 mL) were incubated\
with 25 lL of the same enzyme pool for 5 h. Temperature\
stability was measured by first heating 20 lL of\
the same enzyme solution at the same temperature range\
without substrate for 1 h, followed by addition of 1 mL\
0.5 mg/mL colanic acid in 50 mM phosphate buffer pH 7\
and 5 h incubation at 30 C.\
