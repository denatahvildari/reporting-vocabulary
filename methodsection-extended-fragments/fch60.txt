CWM-s, as well as the corresponding pectin and pellet
fractions, were analyzed for their neutral sugar compositions
using gas chromatography, after derivatization to
alditol acetates (Englyst and Cummings, 1984 ). Inositol
was used as internal standard. The samples were hydrolyzed
in 72% (w/w) H2 SO4  for 1 h at 30  C, followed by a
treatment in 1 M H2 SO4  for 3 h at 100  C. The uronic acid
content of the samples was determined by an automated mhydroxydiphenyl
assay (Blumenkrantz and Asboe-Hansen,
1973; Thibault and Robin, 1975 ). Analysis of the neutral
sugar composition and uronic acid content of the samples
were performed in duplicate.
