A Waters 600E high-performance liquid chromatograph equipped with a Dilutor 401 injector (Gilson) and an FL2000 fluorometer-detector (excitation wavelength, 390 nm; emission wavelength, 480 nm; Spectra Physics) was used. Elution solvent A contained 5% (vol/vol) aqueous acetonitrile and 0.25% (vol/vol) glacial acetic acid (pH 3.5), and solvent B contained 90% acetonitrile and 0.25% glacial acetic acid in water. The following elution profile was used: isocratic conditions (100% solvent A) for 2 min, followed by a linear gradient to 35% solvent B in 35 min and to 100% solvent B in the next 3 min, maintenance of 100% solvent B for 5 min, and then a return to the initial conditions for reequilibration (15 min) before the next sample was loaded. The flow rate was maintained at 1 ml/min.
