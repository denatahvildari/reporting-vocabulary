The released sugars were
analysed using high performance anion exchange chromatography
(HPAEC) with pulsed amperometric detection
(PAD) as described by Verhoef and coworkers.13
 2.5. Absolute configuration
The absolute configurations of the monosaccharides
present in the EPS were determined as described by  Gerwig and coworkers.16  The GC-FID analyses of the
tri-methylsilated (/ )-2-butyl glycosides was performed
using a Carlo Erba Mega 5160 GC, equipped with a CPSil
5 CB column (25 m/ 0.32 mm, Chrompack). The
temperature programme was: 80/ 135 8 C at 20 8 C/min;
135/ 220 8 C at 2 8 C/min. The injection port and detector
temperatures were 200 and 250 8 C, respectiv ely. The
Helium flow rate was 3 mL/min and the samples
(approx. 0.5 m L) were injected directly on the column
without a stream splitter.
