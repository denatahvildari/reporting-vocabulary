\f0\fs24 \cf0 U-HPLC-MS analysis of oligosaccharide-hydroxy-arylesters\
The compositions of the reaction mixtures from oligosaccharide\
hydroxy-arylation and the SPE fractions were determined using\
U-HPLC-MS equipment and columns as described elsewhere.12\
For the reaction mixture analysis, 3 lL of a 200-diluted sample\
in DMSO was injected. For the SPE fractions, 5 lL of a 5 mg/mL\
solution in water was injected. For elution (30 C), a gradient was\
applied at 300 lL/min using the following two eluents: A: water\
containing 1% (v/v) acetonitril and 1% (v/v) HOAc; B: acetonitril\
containing 1% (v/v) HOAc. Gradient: 0???2 min: 95???80% A; 2???\
9 min: 80???70% A; 9???11 min: 70???60% A; 11???15 min: 60???20% A;\
15???16 min: 20???0% A; 16???18 min: 0% A isocratic; 18???22 min: 0???\
95% A; 22???26 min: 95% A isocratic. Linear gradients were used in\
all non-isocratic steps. Detection was performed by the PDA detector\
scanning between 200 and 400 nm. Half of the eluent was led\
to the ESI-MS system running in the negative mode. Helium was\
used as a sheath gas and nitrogen as auxiliary gas. The capillary\
temperature was set at 250 C and the spray voltage at 4.7 kV. Settings\
of the MS were tuned using a purified saccharose-HPP monoester\
sample. After each first scan event, being a full scan between\
m/z 300???2000, MS/MS analysis was performed in a second scan\
event for the most intense ion in the full MS spectrum, using normalized\
collision energy of 35.0 units. During the first 3.5 min of\
each run, eluent was directed to the waste in order to protect the MS from DMSO influx. Data were processed using XCalibur software\
(Thermo Scientific).}
