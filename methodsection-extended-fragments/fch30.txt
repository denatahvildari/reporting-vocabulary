The samples were loaded onto an ion exchange HPLC (Biochrom 20 Plus, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Staffanstorp, Sweden) employing postcolumn derivatisation with ninhydrin and
detection at 570 nmwith proline detected at 440 nm. The chromatograms
were integrated using specific software (ChromCard version 2.3.3, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) with amino acids identified and quantified by retention time against a standard amino acid mixture. Tryptophan and cysteine were not determined. The crosslinked
amino acids lysinoalanine and lanthionine were assessed using standards obtained from PolyPeptide Laboratories (Strasbourg, France). The amount of OMIU-reactive lysine was determined in triplicate according to the method of Moughan and Rutherfurd
(1996) and amino acid analysis described above. O-methylisourea (Fluka) and the L-homoarginine standard (Sigma) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (Zwijndrecht, The Netherlands). The total carbohydrate content, and carbohydrate composition
was determined by gas chromatography (GC), using inositol as internal standard (Englyst and Cummings, 1984). The samples were treated with 72% (w/w) H2SO4 (1 h, 30 C) followed by hydrolysis with 1 M H2SO4 for 3 h at 100 C. The constituent sugars released
were analyzed as their alditol acetates by GC. Monosaccharide analysis was performed using a Dionex ICS 3000 High Performance
Anion Exchange Chromatography (HPAEC) system (Sunnyvale, CA,
USA), with pulsed amperometric detection. Samples were diluted
500  with water before analysis and 20 lL was injected into the
system. Separation was achieved using a CarboPac PA-1 column
(2  250 mm) preceded by a CarboPac PA-1 guard column
(2  250 mm). The monomers in the samples were eluted with a
gradient of 0.02–0.05 M NaOH for 3 min and 0.05–0.075 M NaOH
for 10 min, followed by isocratic elution of 0.1 M NaOH for 2 min.
Subsequently, the column was washed with 1 M NaOAc in 0.1 M
NaOH for 7 min. Equilibration of the column was achieved in
0.1 M NaOH for 3 min followed by 0.02 M NaOH for 20 min.
Furfural and 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furfural (5-HMF), by-products
which can be formed when respectively hexoses and pentoses are
degraded, were determined by HPLC using an Aminex HPX-87H
column and UV-/RI-detection (280 nm) in soluble hydrolysates
from pretreated wheat bran. Acrylamide, which is formed in an
advanced Maillard reaction from aspartic acid, was measured in
the untreated wheat bran and in the four samples pretreated at
180 C. Acrylamide was quantified by LC–MS/MS with positive
electrospray ionization using an Applied Biosystem API 4000 triple
quadrupole mass spectrometer (Darmstadt, Germany) coupled to
an Agilent 1100 LC system (Waldbronn, Germany), as previously
described by Hoenicke and Gatermann (2005). The degree of
browning of the samples, as a measure of melanoidin formation,
was determined by liberation of brown pigments from protein
molecules by means of the proteolytic enzyme pronase according
to the method of Palombo et al. (1984).
The digestibility of proteins in the pretreated samples was assessed
in vitro by subsequent incubation with pepsin (at pH 1)
and pancreatin (at pH 6.8) according to the method of Babinszky
et al. (1990).
All analyses were performed in duplicate, apart from amino acid
and OMIU-reactive lysine analyses which were performed in
triplicate.
