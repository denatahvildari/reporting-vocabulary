For determining what fraction of the a-lactalbumin monomers
was incorporated into protein oligomers and protein polymers, size
exclusion chromatography (SEC) was performed on 100 mL aliquots
taken from the reaction mixture at various reaction times. The aliquots
were injected on a Bio-Silect SEC 400-5300 mm  7.8 mm
column, connected to a Biologic DuoFlow Chromatography system.
Elution was done using 0.1 M NH4Ac (pH 6.8), detection at 280 nm.
Prior to injection, the column was equilibrated with the elution
buffer. For determining (weight) fractions of monomers, oligomer
and protein polymers, chromatograms were divided into three regions.
The non (intermolecularly) cross-linked a-lactalbumin
monomers eluted from 11 mL to 12.2 mL. The exclusion limit of the
Bio-Silect SEC 400-5 column was reported to be around 106 g/mol
for globular proteins, and for the purpose of the present determination,
any cross-linked protein products eluting in the void (that
is, at elution volumes smaller than 7.5 mL) were classified as
protein polymer whereas cross-linked protein products at intermediate
elution volumes (from 7.5 mL to 12.2 mL) were classified as
protein oligomers???. For all aliquots, the estimated error in the total
area under chromatograms was about 5%. The fraction of each
species was taken to be the ratio of the area in the chromatogram
for that particular species, divided by the total area for the three
species combined. The whole experiment has been carried out in
duplicate, with very similar results. The duplicate experiment was
performed by using a Superose 6 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare,
Uppsala, Sweden) connected to an Akta Purifier system at room
temperature. Samples were eluted with 0.1 M NH4Ac buffer pH 6.8
at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min, detection was done at 280 nm.
