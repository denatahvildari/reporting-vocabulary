The amount of total fatty acids and the fatty-acid composition
were analyzed using a modified gas chromatography method
[128]. Saponification reagent (1.2 ml of 3.75 M NaOH in 50/
50 v/v methanol/water) was added to 12 mg freeze-dried biomass
to liberate the fatty acid from cellular lipid. After vortex
mixing for 10 sec the samples were placed at 100??C for 30
min. After cooling for 15 min to room temperature, 2.4 ml of
methylation reagent (3.25 M HCl in methanol) was added and
after vortex mixing for 10 sec the samples were placed at 80??C
for 20 min. After cooling down to room temperature, the
fatty-acid methyl esters were extracted by adding 1.5 ml hexane
reagent (50/50 v/v hexane/methyl tertiary butyl ether).
Samples were mixed for 15 min and centrifuged (3 min, 1,834
g). The aqueous layer was removed and the organic phase was
washed by adding 3.0 ml washing agent (0.3 M NaOH). The
samples were mixed for 5 min and centrifuged again (3 min,
1,834 g). The organic phase was finally transferred to a gas
chromatograph vial and analyzed using a 6890 Agilent gas
chromatograph [129]. The standards and samples were
injected into the gas chromatograph equipped with a flame
ionization detector via an automated sequence run. An Agilent
19091B-102 capillary column (Ultra 2; 5% Phe-methylsiloxane;
25 m ??~ 0.200 mm; film thickness 0.33 ??m) was used.
Oven temperature was programmed as follows: 60??C, hold 3
min; 280??C at 25??C/min, hold 4 min; 320??C at 15??C/min,
hold 2 min; 340??C at 20??C/min, hold 0 min). The injector
temperature was set at 275??C and detector temperature was
set at 375??C. Helium was used as carrier gas at a constant
flow-application of 2.0 ml/min. Fatty-acid methyl esters were
identified by their retention times in comparison to those of a
commercial standard (Microbial ID, Inc., Newark, DE, USA).
Calibration curves of pure fatty acids present in N. meningitidis
were made based on the identified fatty acids [128] and
confirmed in literature [130]. The pure fatty acids used as calibration
standards were dissolved in dichloromethane
(Sigma, St Louis, MO). All fatty acids were purchased from
Sigma, except for palmitelaidic acid (C16:1-trans 9) which
was purchased from ICN Biomedicals (MP Biomedicals,
Irvine, CA). Hydroxy-fatty acids were quantified using C12:0-
2OH as an internal standard, whereas non-hydroxy-fatty
acids have been quantified using C15:0 as an internal standard.
The measured fatty-acid concentrations were corrected
for salt present in the freeze-dried biomass. The measured
fatty-acid composition and the assembly into lipid can be
found in Additional data file 2.
