The thawed suspension was incubated for 30 min at RT, 75 Ubenzonase (Merck) were added and the suspension was sonicated. Centrifugation (40,000 ?? g, 40 min, 4???C) yielded the crude extract,and BliPAE was purified via affinity chromatography using a 1-ml Strep-Tactin Superflow Plus Column (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany)according to the manufacturer???s instructions. For enzyme concentration and buffer exchange, Vivaspin columns (MWCO 10 kDa;Sartorius, G??ttingen, Germany) and 20 mM triethanolamine buffer(pH 7.0) were used. Finally, the enzyme solution was comple-mented with glycerol (f.c. 10%) and stored at 4???C.
