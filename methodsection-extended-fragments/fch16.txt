Distinction between galacturonic acid and glucuronic acid was made
by high performance anion-exchange chromatography (HPAEC,
Dionex, USA) after methanolysis according to De Ruiter et al.51
Sugar composition
The neutral sugar composition of okra AIS was determined by
gas chromatography52 using inositol as internal standard. The samples
were submitted to a prehydrolysis treatment with 72% w/w
sulfuric acid at 30 C for 1 h followed by a hydrolyses step using
1 M sulfuric acid at 100 C for 3 h. The sugars were converted to
their alditol acetates and analysed by GC according to Hilz et al.25
For the obtained fractions, after drying at 40 C under vacuum
over P2O5, the samples were hydrolysed with 2 M HCl in dry methanol
at 80 C for 16 h and followed by 2 MTFA at 121 C for 1 h. The
monomers were analysed by using high performance anion-exchange
chromatography (HPAEC, Dionex, USA) equipped with the
(2  250 mm) CarboPac PA 1 column (Dionex, USA) and post column
(Dionex, USA) addition. Millipore water, 0.1 M NaOH and
1 M NaOAc in 0.1 M NaOH with a flow of 0.3 mL/min at 20 C were
used as eluent, and 0.5 M NaOH with a flow of 0.1 mL/min at 20 C
was added to post column for allowance of the PAD detection.
The following gradient was applied using a flow of 0.3 mL/min
at 20 C of NaOH: 0???30.0 min, 0 mM; 30.0???30.1 min, 0???100 mM;
30.1???50.0 min, 100 mM. The simultaneous gradient of NaOAc
was 0.0???30.1 min, 0 mM; 30.1???45.0 min min, 0???400 mM; 45.1???
50.0, 1000 mM. Millipore water was used from 0.0 to 30.0 min.
For the post column, 0.5 M NaOH with a flow of 0.1 mL/min was
used during 0.0???30.1 min. After each run the column was washed
for 5 min with 1 M NaOAc in 0.1 M NaOH, for 8 min with 0.1 M
NaOH and subsequently equilibrated with water for 15 min.53
