Materials The roots of G. glabra, collected in Afghanistan, All samples were thawed and centrifuged before analysis. Fractions collected were analyzed by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC)- mass spectrometry at a concentration of 1 mg/mL.
Reversed-phase UHPLC Samples were analyzed using an Accela UHPLC system (Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA, USA) equipped with pump, autosampler, and PDA detector. Samples (1 ??L) were injected onto an Acquity UPLC BEH C18 column (2.1??~150 mm, 1.7 ??m particle size) with an Acquity UPLC BEH C18 Vanguard pre-column (2.1??~ 5 mm, 1.7 ??m particle size; Waters, Milford, MA, USA). Eluents were water-acidified with 0.1% (v/v) acetic acid (eluent A) and acetonitrile-acidified with 0.1% (v/v) aceticacid (eluent B). The flow rate was 300 ??L/min, and the PDA detector was set to measure at a range of 205???400 nm. The following elution profile was used at 0???18 min, linear gradient from 10???100% (v/v) B; 18???22 min, isocratic on 100% B; 22???23 min, linear gradient from 100???10% B; and 23???25 min, isocratic on 10% B. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) Mass spectrometric data were obtained by analyzing samples on an ion trap LTQ-XL (Thermo Scientific) equipped with an ESI-MS probe coupled to the reversed-phase UHPLC. Helium was used as sheath gas and nitrogen as auxiliary gas. Data were collected over an m/z-range of 150???1,500. Data-dependent tandem mass spectrometry (MSn) analysis was performed with a normalized collision energy of 35%. The MSn fragmentation was always performed on the most intense daughter ion in the MSn???1 spectrum. Most settings were optimized via automatic tuning using ???Tune Plus??? (Xcalibur 2.0.7, Thermo Scientific). To this end, the system was tuned with glabridin in both positive ionization and negative ionization mode. In both modes, the ion transfer tube temperature was 350 ??C and the source voltage, 4.8 kV. Data acquisition and reprocessing were done with Xcalibur 2.0.7. Mass spectral data interpretation and peak determination were performed with Mass Frontier 5.0 (Highchem, Bratislava, Slovakia).
