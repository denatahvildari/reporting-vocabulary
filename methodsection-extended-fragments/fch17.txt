Purification of Axe2 and Axe3
An Akta purifier chromatography system and column used for the protein purification were obtained from GE Healthcare. The eluates were monitored at 215, 280 and 320 nm. The fermentation supernatants containing Axe2 or Axe3 were applied to a Superdex 75 gel filtration column (10 mm ???? 300 mm), equilibrated with 50 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, containing 50 mM NaCl. The proteins were eluted using the same buffer at a flow rate of 0.8 mL/min. Two protein peaks were eluted from the column for both enzyme samples: the activity assays used showed that the first peak did not contain any esterase activity, while the second peak showed high activity towards AcXOS in both cases. Fractions (0.5 mL), containing esterase activity, were collected, pooled and were subsequently
stored in small aliquots at ???20 ???C. SDS-PAGE of peak 1 showed that the proteins represented the host proteins (based on a background control), while hardly any protein was detected in peak
