High-performance anion exchange chromatography
(HPAEC) was performed on a Dionex
(United States) HPLC system. The system was
equipped with a quaternary gradient pump, an
AS3000 autosampler complete with a helium
degassing unit, and an ED40 EC detector in a
pulsed amperometric detection mode (PAD) mode.
A CarboPac PA1 column (2 3  250 mm; Dionex)
with a CarboPac PA1 guard column (2 3  50 mm;
Dionex) was operated at a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min
at 20 8 C. The gradient was obtained by solutions
of 1 M NaOAc in 0.1 M NaOH being mixed with
0.1 M NaOH. After 15 min of equilibration with
0.1 M NaOH, 20 l L of the sample was injected,
and a linear gradient to 0.50 M NaOAc in 0.1 M
NaOH within 30 min was followed by a linear
gradient in 5 min to 1 M NaOAc in 0.1 M NaOH.
Finally, the column was washed for 5 min with 1
M NaOAc in 0.1 M NaOH. The data were processed
with a Chromeleon (Dionix) data handling
system.
