Samples were analyzed on high-performance anionexchange
chromatography (HPAEC) system (ISC-3000 System,
Dionex) equipped with a CarboPac PA1 analytical column
and a CarboPac PA1 guard column and a pulsed amperometric
detector (Dionex). Linkage analyses were performed
according to the Hakamori procedure as described in Ref. 28:
Only neutral sugars present in the pectins were included in
the analysis as galacturonic acids were not reduced before
methylation. The levels of methyl esters and acetyl groups
were analyzed by Ultimate 3000 HPLC system (Dionex) after
chemical saponification of the pectins as described in Ref. 23.
High-performance size exclusion chromatography was performed
using Dionex Ultimate 3000 system equipped with a
series of three TosoHaas TSK-Gel G columns (4000WXL,
3000PWXL, 2500PWXL; Tosho Bioscience) and a Shodex refractive
index detector (Showa Denko) as described in Ref. 28.
