FaeA1 was purified by size exclusion chromatography using an ??KTApurifier 10
analytical system (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) equipped with a SuperdexTM 75 analytical column (10/300 GL, 1 column volume (CV) = 23.56 ml; GE Healthcare) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min at 20 ???C. The sample was manually injected via a 200 l sample loop and eluted with 50 mM NaCl in 50 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0). Fractions of 200 l were collected in microtiter plates using an AKTA Frac-950 fraction collector (GE Healthcare).
FaeA2 and FaeB2 were purified by hydrophobic interaction chromatography
followed by anion exchange chromatography using an ??KTAexplorer 100 preparative system (GE Healthcare). The system was equipped with a self-packed Phenyl SepharoseTM HP column (XK16, 58 ml column volume; GE Healthcare) that was equilibrated with 5 CV of 10 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) containing 1.5 M ammonium sulfate (buffer A). The samples (17.5 ml) were mixed 1:1 with 20 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) containing 3 M ammonium sulfate. They were cooled on ice for 30 min and subsequently centrifuged (5 min, 5000 ????g, 4 ???C). The supernatants were injected onto the column via a sample pump at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. The samples were eluted at a flow rate of 10 ml/min at 20 ???C with 10 mM sodium
sulfate buffer (buffer B, pH 5.0): 3 CV 0% B, 2 CV 0???30% linear B, 28 CV 30???100% linear B, 5 CV 100% B, 5 CV 0% B (equilibration). Fractions (20 ml) were collected in glass tubes cooled on ice using an ??KTA Frac-900 fraction collector. Active fractions (FaeA2: 29.3???33.2 CV, FaeB2: 32.5???34.9 CV) were pooled and extensively dialyzed (2 ???? 24 h, 4 ???C) against 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) using 12???14 kDa cut-off Visking dialysis tubings (Medicell International Ltd.,
London, UK). The dialyzed fractions were further purified using a self-packed Q SepharoseTM anion exchange column (XK26, V = 53 ml, GE Healthcare). Samples
were eluted with 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) containing 1 M sodium
chloride (buffer B) using a linear elution profile: 2 CV 0% B, 20 CV 0???50% linear B (22 CV for FaeB2), 1 CV 50???100% linear B, 2 CV 100% B, 5 CV 0% B (equilibration). Active fractions (FaeA2: 7.4???8.9 CV, FaeB2: 13.2???14.3 CV) were pooled and dialyzed against 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) containing 50 mM sodium chloride
(10???12 kDa cut-off, 24 h, 4 ???C).
