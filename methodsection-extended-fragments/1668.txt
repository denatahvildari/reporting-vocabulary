Samples of 0.25 mL were taken and added to a measuring flask containing hydrochloric acid
(pH . 1) to inactivate the enzyme. After 1 min, an equimolar amount of sodium hydroxide was added to neutralise and the measuring flask was filled with distilled water. 5 mL-samples were taken and filtered through a 0.45-mm disposable filter (Schleicher & Schuell, Dassel, Germany). The filtered sample was diluted approximately 200 times, and 0.75 mL sample was taken and analysed by HPLC. The concentrations were calculated using calibration curves; more information on the analysis method can be found in [14].
