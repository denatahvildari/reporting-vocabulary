Hydrophobic chromatography was used to obtain a relative expression of hydrophobic exposure of the different proteins. A Phenyl FF column (high sub, 5 mL; GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences) was used, with elution buffers A: 10 mmol L???1 BisTris-HCl, pH 7.0; B: buffer A + 0.85 mol L???1 ammonium sulfate; and C: buffer A + 1mol L???1 ammonium sulfate. In those cases where a protein was found to be insoluble in 1mol L???1 ammonium sulfate, buffer B was used instead of buffer C. The column was equilibrated in buffer C and samples were prepared by dissolving 10 mg in 1 mL buffer C and centrifuging for 5 min at 12 000 rpm (Eppendorf centrifuge). A flow rate of 5mLmin???1 was used and each experiment started by equilibration of the column with 5 column volumes (CV), followed by injection of 500 ??L sample, followed by 2 CV of buffer C. The samples were then eluted with a gradient from 100% buffer C to 100% buffer A, over a length of 20 CV, followed by 2 CV of 100% buffer A. Detection took place at 280 nm and the exposed hydrophobicity is expressed as one minus the molarity of ammonium sulfate, where the highest absorbance is measured in the detector (this
approach has also been used by Franco et al.38).
