\f0\fs24 \cf0 The amount of hexanal formed in the course of oil oxidation was\
measured using a Carlo Erba (Milan, Italy) GC 8000 TOP gas\
chromatograph equipped with a COMBI-PAL (CTC Analytics,\
Zwingen, Switzerland) headspace sampler and a wide-bore thickfilm\
capillary DB-WAX column (30 m; 0.54 mm i.d.; 1 mm\
thickness, J&W Scientific, Folsom, USA). The temperature\
program was as follows: 0 to 5 min at 50 C (isothermal),\
increasing to 150 C at 10 C/min, then over 25 min gradually\
decreasing to 50 C. The samples were incubated at 60 C for\
10 min in a 2,000 rpm agitator operating with a 10 s run/10 s stop\
cycle prior to injection. The volatiles were cold-trapped in MFA\
815 cold trap (Carlo Erba, Milan, Italy) at 110 C and injected\
ballistically into the column at 240 C; the headspace sample\
volume was 2 ml. The helium pressure was 30 kPa; the injection\
syringe temperature was 70 C; the injector temperature was\
200 C; and the flame ionization detector temperature was 225 C.\
GC data was processed with Chrom Card integration software\
(Carlo Erba).\
