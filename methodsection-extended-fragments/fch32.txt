Fractionation based on size exclusion chromatography
The separation of apolar oligosaccharides was performed on an
AKTA explorer (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) equipped with a
size exclusion Bio-Gel P2 column (900  26 mm; 200???400 mesh,
BioRad) as described previously.2 The instrument was equipped
with both a Shodex RI 72 Refractive Index (Showa Denko, Kawasaki,
and Japan) and PDA detector (GE Healthcare). A flow rate of
1.2 mL/min was used. In total, 867.5 mg of the apolar (feruloylated
and/or acetylated) oligosaccharides was dissolved in 12 mL of distilled
water. Three runs were performed in which 4 mL of sample
was injected each time. During each run fractions (2 mL) were collected.
Based on the RI signal and analysis by MALDI-TOF-MS fractions
with similar contents were pooled and lyophilized resulting
in samples A up to Q. The recovery was about 90% (w/w) of the
DM applied onto the column. The carbohydrate content of samples
A to H was determined after acid methanolysis by high pressure
anion exchange chromatography as described elsewhere.2 For
samples I???Q no carbohydrate content was determined due to small
sample amounts. Based on the average carbohydrate content of
samples A???H, samples I???Q together are expected to contain
??18 mg of oligosaccharides.
