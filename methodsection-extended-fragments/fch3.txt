Fractionation of hemicelluloses with anion exchange
chromatography
About 250 mg CASS were dissolved in water and centrifuged.
The pellet was collected (CASS residue) and the
supernatant was fractionated on a DEAE Sepharose Fast
Flow column (100 cm????2.6 cm, GE Healthcare, Upsala,
Sweden) into three fractions: unbound material was eluted with
530mL 5mM sodium acetate at pH 5.0 (CASS unbound), the
second fraction was eluted with 530mL 2M sodium acetate
buffer at pH 5.0 (CASS NaOAc), and the last fraction was
eluted with 530mL 0.5M sodium hydroxide (CASS NaOH)
[25]. Sugar composition as alditol acetates
For determining the sugar composition, samples were prehydrolysed
using 72%, w/w sulphuric acid at 30 ???C for 1 h and
subsequently hydrolyzed with 1M sulphuric acid at 100 ???C for
3 h [26]. Afterwards the sugars were derivatised to their alditol
acetates and determined by gas chromatography [27] using inositol
as internal standard.
