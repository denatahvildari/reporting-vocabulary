The volume of the chloroform fraction containing hydrophobic compounds was reduced with a rotavapor, and the concentrated solution was analysed by gas chromatography (GC) after methanolysis (Lageveen et al. 1988 ). Methylesters were analysed by GC using a Carlo- Erba GC6000 apparatus equipped with a 25 m CPSil5CB capillary column (Chrompack). Peaks corresponding to the monomeric units of the extracted polymer were identified by comparing their retention times with those of the monomers present in pure mcl-PHAs isolated from P. putida  KT2442 (monomer composition shown in Table 1 )
