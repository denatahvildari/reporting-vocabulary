anion exchange chromatography
The crude culture filtrate was ultra-filtered (Amicon
10 kDa cut off) and washed with Millipore water
(<20 lS/cm2) followed by 25 mM Tris/HCl buffer
pH = 7 and then applied on a Mono Q 5/50 GL
(Amersham Biosciences) anion exchange column
equilibrated with the same buffer. The protein was
eluted from the column by increasing the ionic strength
at a flow rate of 1 mL/min from 0 to 1 M NaCl in
20 column volumes, and fractions (0.5 mL) were
collected. Figure 1. Structure of the repeating unit of colanic acid.9,10
