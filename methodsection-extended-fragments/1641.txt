Samples
were taken throughout the experiment, treated and analyzed for the composition of monomeric sugars, organic acids, glycerol and ethanol by high-pressure liquid chromatography methods as described previously [14]. All distillate fractions were analyzed for their ethanol content by gas liquid chromatography using a flame ionization detector (GLC-FID). The final distillate sample (all combined distillate fractions with sufficient ethanol content) was analyzed for water content (Karl Fischer titration, ASTM D 1364), acidity (acid-base titration, ASTM D 1613), anion content (chloride, sulphate, nitrate and carbonate measured by ion exchange chromatography (ICE)) and organic components other than ethanol (gas liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (GLCMS)). For determination of the VFA concentration, samples were withdrawn, centrifuged for 10 minutes at 10000 rpm and analyzed on a gas chromatograph (Hewlett Packard 5890 series II) with a 30 m Alltech column (AT-Aquawax-DA 0.32 mm ??~ 0.25 mm). The temperatures of the column, injection port and FID were 80??C (beginning) to 220??C (end), 275??C and 300??C, respectively. Nitrogen saturated with formic acid was used as the carrier gas (20 ml/minute). The volume of produced biogas was determined using the Oxitop pressure measurement system. The quantities of these components in the reactor gas were determined on a gas chromatograph (Hewlett Packard 5890) with two different columns: 30 m Molsieve 5A 0.53 mm ??~ 15 ??m and 25 m Poraplot Q 0.53 mm ??~ 20 ??m. The carrier gas was helium and the temperatures of the column, injection port and the thermal conductivity detector were 45??C, 110??C and 99??C, respectively.
