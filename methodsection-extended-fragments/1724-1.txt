\f0\fs24 \cf0 The samples were analyzed by HPLC to determine the unreacted substrates using a Waters 717 Plus\
 auto-sampler, Waters 1525 binary HPLC pump and a Waters 2414 refraction index detector. Samples and standards in toluene/ tert  -butanol were dried under reduced pressure (1000 mbar) at 40 o  C. The solid was dissolved in Milli-Q water: tert- butanol\
(4:1). 20 ??  l of fi nal solution were eluted in an ionic exchange column Alltech OA-100 (sulfonated polystyrene- divinylbenzene) with 3 mM aqueous sulfuric acid.\
The same procedure was used for the standard curve. Chromatographic analysis (HPLC ??? MS)\
HPLC analysis was carried out using a Waters 2690 equipment provided with a pump, degasser, auto sampler, column oven, diode-array detector, and coupled\
to an MS system, fitted with an electrospray\
probe. The analyses were performed with a 250  3\
mm ODS-2 Intersil (Varian Inc.) column at 40 o C.\
The elution phase A consisted of acetonitrile (Merck)\
and the elution phase B was ultra-pure water. Both\
mobile phases were supplemented with 0.1% (v/v)\
trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). Gradient elution was\
held for 5 minutes at 5% (v/v) A then ramping up\
to 95% (v/v) A. The fl ow rate was 1.0 mL.min 1\
and the injection volume was 10 ?? L. 0.2 mL.min 1\
of the outlet fl ow were pumped into an atmospheric\
pressure chemical ionisation mass spectrometer\
(APCI-MS) (LCQ, Thermo Finnigan, San Jose,\
USA). Quantitative analysis was based on integration\
of the peak areas in the chromatogram assuming\
that the response factors for all products observed\
was one.}
