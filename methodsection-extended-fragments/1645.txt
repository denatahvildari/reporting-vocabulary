To measure the concentration of DCM in different
water???methanol mixtures, a Hewlett Packard 6890 Series gas
chromatograph equipped with a 30m????0.32mm????1m capillary
column, Chrompac 8762 CP Sil 19CB, with back injector
(split ratio of 200:1) and flame ionization detector was used.
The temperature program was initially set to 100 ???C and
increased linearly to 160 ???C in seven min. Helium was used
as carrier gas at a flow rate of 367.6 ml min???1. To obtain the
actual concentration of the components, calibration curves were
used.
