Sugar compositionwas determined according to De Ruiter, Schols,
Voragen, and Rombouts (1992). Samples were dried at 40 C under
vacuum over P2O5 and hydrolyzed with 2 N HCl in dry methanol
for 16 h at 80 C followed by evaporation and subsequent 2 M
TFA hydrolysis at 121 C for 1 h. Monomeric sugars were analyzed
using high-performance anion-exchange chromatography  pulsed
amperometric detection (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) analysis
as described previously (Sengkhamparn, Verhoef, Schols,
Sajjaanantakul, & Voragen, 2009). Total neutral sugar contents
were determined with the orcinol-sulfuric acid colour assay (Tollier
& Robin, 1979) and uronic acids contents with the m-hydroxydiphenyl
assay (Ahmed & Labavitch,1978), both using an automated
colorimetric assay analyser. As standards galactose or glucose (25e
200 mg/mL) and galacturonic acid (12.5e100.0 mg/mL) were used,
respectively.
