\f0\fs24 \cf0 The degree of polymerization (DP) of the galacturonic acid\
oligomers obtained after digestion of pectin by endo-PG was\
analyzed by high-performance anion-exchange chromatography\
(HPAEC; Dionex Bio-LC system, USA) at pH 12 as described\
by Verlent et al. (21), using a CarboPac PA1 column with guard.\
Detection was achieved using pulsed amperometric detection\
(PAD) with a gold working electrode. Prior to injection, PGtreated\
pectins were diluted to 2 g/L with 0.2 M NaOH. Due to\
the high pH, all methyl-ester groups were de-esterified instantaneously\
when the samples were diluted in NaOH. Consequently,\
separation of the pectin fragments was based only on\
their degree of polymerization and not on their residual degree\
or pattern of methyl-esterification. The elution times of the\
mono-, di-, and trimer of galacturonic acid were identified by\
running standard solutions. The elution times of other galacturonic\
acid oligomers were determined by comparison of the\
elution profile of the digested pectin with the profile of\
polygalacturonic acid digested by endo-PG. It should be noted\
that the PAD detector could not provide analysis beyond a\
degree of polymerization (DP) of 10 and that the sensitivity of\
the detector varies with the oligomers according to their DP.\
Monogalacturonic acid (40 ppm) was injected before and after\
each set of samples to verify the reproducibility.}
