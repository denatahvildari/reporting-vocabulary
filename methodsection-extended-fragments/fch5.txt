Samples were analysed on a Thermo Accela UHPLC system (San Jose, CA, USA) equipped with pump, auto sampler and photo-diode array (PDA) detector. Samples (1 mL) were injected on a Waters Acquity UPLC BEH C18 column (2.1150 mm, 1.7mm particle size) with a Waters Acquity
UPLC BEH C18 Vanguard pre-column (2.15 mm, 1.7mm particle size; Waters, Milford, MA, USA). Water acidified with 0.1% (v/v) acetic acid (eluent A) and acetonitrile (ACN) acidified with 0.1% (v/v) acetic acid (eluent B) were used as eluents. The flow rate was 300mL/min, and the PDA detector was set to measure in the range of 205–400 nm. The following elution profile was used: 0–18 min, linear gradient from 10%– 100% (v/v) B; 18–22 min, isocratic on 100% B; 22–23 min, linear gradient from 100%–10% B; 23–25 min, isocratic on 10% B. (ESI-MS) Mass spectrometric data were obtained by analysing samples on a Thermo Scientific LTQ-XL (San Jose, CA, USA) equipped with an ESI probe coupled to the reversed-phase RP)-UHPLC system. Of the flow from the RP-UHPLC system, 150 mL/min was directed to the mass spectrometer. Helium was used as sheath gas and nitrogen as auxiliary gas. Data were collected over an m/z-range of 150–1500. Data dependent. Most settings were optimised using ‘tune plus’ (Xcalibur 2.07, Thermo Scientific) via automatic tuning. The system was tuned with glabridin in both PI and NI mode. In the NI mode, the ion transfer tube temperature was 3508C and the source voltage 4.5 kV. In the PI mode, the ion transfer tube temperature was 3508C and the source voltage 5.0 kV. Data acquisition and reprocessing were performed with Xcalibur 2.07 (Thermo Scientific). Mass spectral data interpretation and peak determination were performed with Mass Frontier 4.0 (Highchem, Bratislava,
Slovakia).
