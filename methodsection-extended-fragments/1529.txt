After addition of an internal standard (2,3,5,6,3? -pentachlorobiphenyl (CB112)), the extract was concentrated on a rotary evaporator, and the extract was cleaned by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) over Polymer Laboratories (PL) gel column (600/ 25 mm, pore size 10 m m), using dichloromethane at 10 ml/min. The fraction between 17 and 23 min, representative for compounds with molecular mass lower than m/z 1000 and free of triglycerids, was collected. The fraction was concentrated under nitrogen to approximately 200 m l. The final analysis was carried out with GC/MS, using electron capture negativ e ionisation (ECNI) as ionisation technique with methane as a reagent gas. A 50 mCP Sil 8 column (i.d. 0.25 mm, film thickness 0.25 m m) under full scan conditions (m/z 34/ 800) was utilised. In addition, an electron impact (EI) full scan screening (m/z 34/ 800) was performed. The peak identification was based on a comparison of MS-spectra from the NIST98 library and using the deconvolution peak identification programme AMDIS.
