Isolation of active compounds. G. macrorrhizum compounds from the WW fraction after RP-MPLC pre-separation were finally purified by semi-preparative RP-HPLC techniques on a C18 column, 5 mm, 25010 mm i.d., 300  (Rainin, Emeryville, USA). RP-MPLC consisted of a Gilson 802C pump, a Jobin Yvon axial compression system (I.S.A. Jobin Yvon, Longjumeau, France), a Gilson 202 Fraction Collector, a Gilson 201???202 Fraction Controller and a Gilson 111 LC UV detector (254 nm) connected to a Kipp & Zonen BD 40 recorder. The separation was carried out on a RP-18 462 cm i.d. column containing 60 g Baker Bond Phase C-18 stationary phase (Mallinckrodt Baker, Deventer, The Netherlands) with two eluents???A (10% MeOH in H2O) and B (MeOH) at the following elution conditions: 0???15 min 0% B, 15??? 40 min B increasing to 100% and continuing isocratically for 5 min. Compound 4 from the EB fraction and 3 from the WB fraction were also isolated by RP-MPLC techniques. Other compounds from the EB fraction were isolated on a 40???63 mm particle size silica gel column (Fluka) with CHCl3-MeOH-H2O (60:22:4), and purified on a Sephadex LH-20 (Pharmacia, Stockholm, Sweden) column with MeOH-H2O (50:50) (compounds 5, 6 and 7) or on polyamide column with MeOH. The fractionation conditions for the silica gel column were determined by using Silica gel 60 F254 (Merck) thin layer chromatography (TLC) plates (510 cm) as a
pilot technique.
