\f0\fs24 \cf0 Reversed-phase HPLC??? mass spectrometry\
Reversed-phase HPLC was performed on a HPLC system\
(Thermo Separation Products) equipped with a\
Thermohypersil Aquasil C18 column ((Keystone Scientific);\
4.6 mm ID??~150 mm; 3 m) in combination with\
a Thermohypersil Aquasil C18 guard column (4.6 mm\
ID??~10 mm; 3 m). The RP-column was coupled to a\
splitter (Dionex) directing 10% of the eluent to a Sedex\
55 evaporating light scattering detector (Sedere), 5% to\
a LCQ Ion-trap (Finnigan MAT 95) and the remaining\
part to a fraction collector or waste. Elution (0.8 mL/\
min) was performed using a gradient of degassed\
(Membrane degasser; Thermo Separation Products)\
methanol in pure water: 0???28 v/v% methanol in 0???70\
min. Each elution was followed by a equilibration step\
(isocratic pure water; 30 min). Pool X4Ac (20 mg/mL)\
was subjected to RP chromatography separated in 20\
RP-HPLC runs (20 times 100 L of injection) to obtain\
enough material of each peak to perform NMR analysis.\
Fractions (276 L) were collected by using a fraction\
collector in the same series of tubes for 5 runs.\
Finally, all tubes containing similar material were\
combined.\
