\f0\fs24 \cf0 High-performance anion-exchange chromatography was performed on a Thermo-Quest HPLC system equipped with a Dionex CarboPac PA-1 (4 mm ID \'b7 250 mm) column in combination with a Dionex CarboPac PA guard column (3 mm ID \'b7 25 mm) and a Dionex ED40 PAD-detector (Dionex Co., Sunnyvale, USA). A flow rate of 1 mL/min was used. Arabinogalacto-oligosaccharides were determined using a gradient of sodium acetate in 100 mM NaOH: 0\'9640 min, 0\'96400 mM NaOAc in 100 mM NaOH; 40\'96 41 min, 400\'961000 mM NaOAc in 100 mM NaOH; 41\'9646 min, 1000 mM NaOAc in 100 mM NaOH; 46\'96 60 min, 100 mM NaOH.  The determination of the sugar composition was performed using the same HPAEC system equipped with a Dionex CarboPac PA20 (3 mm ID \'b7  150 mm) in combination with CarboPac PA20 guard column (3 mm ID \'b7  30 mm) and Borate trap (4 mm ID \'b7  50 mm) and separated at 0.5 mL/min by isocratic elution with 3 mM NaOH for 20 min followed by applying a linear gradient from 0 to 700 mM NaOH in 20 min.}
