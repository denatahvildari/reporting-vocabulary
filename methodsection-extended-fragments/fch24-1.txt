\f0\fs24 \cf0 Gas chromatography was carried out using a Hewlett\
Packard 5890 equipped with a flame ionization\
detector (FID). The column was a 30m0.32mm DB624 1.8 mm film (J&W Scientific). The carrier\
gas was hydrogen with a column head pressure of\
65 kPa and a split rate of 1 : 20. Prior to injection,\
0.1 ml of a 210 mg/ml solution of capryllactam was\
added to 0.5 ml of any standard or sample. Injection\
volume was 1 ml. The injector port and FID were\
heated to 220C and 240C respectively. The oven\
temperature was programmed from 180C held for 2\
minutes, to 240C at 10C/min with a final hold for 5\
minutes. Retention times for capryllactam (internal\
standard) and laurolactam were 6.6 and 9.5 minutes\
respectively. }
